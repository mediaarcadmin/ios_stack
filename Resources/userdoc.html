<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px; text-align:left;"><b>Navigation Tips</b></p>
<hr>
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">There are several ways to navigate in a book.  To advance to the next page, swipe your finger right to left, or tap on the right edge of the screen.  To go back to the previous page, swipe from left to right, or tap on the left edge of the screen. To show or hide the top and bottom toolbars, tap on the center of the screen.</p> 
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">To navigate quickly through the book, use the Page Chooser that appears just below the top toolbar.  Slide the thumb to move to the desired point in the book.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px; text-align:left;"><b>Reading Toolbars</b></p>
<hr>
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">When a book is open, toolbars appear at the top and bottom.  The top toolbar has a button on the left which takes you back to the library.  Tap the Add Bookmark icon on the right to bookmark the current page.  The icon will then indicate that the page is bookmarked.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">There are five icons on the bottom bar.  The Back button takes you to the last page you were on, regardless of how you got to the page you're on now.  The Table of Contents button brings up the book's table of contents, from which you can jump to chapters or sections in the book.  You can also see and jump to your bookmarks and notes here. The Search button enables you to search for specific text in the book.  The Play button starts reading the book aloud, either through an audio track or by a text-to-speech voice, if the book has rights and you've purchased a voice.  The Reading Settings button brings up various settings for reading a book, described below.</p> 
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">To hide or show the toolbars, tap the screen.</p>  
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px; text-align:left;"><b>Flowed View</b></p>
<hr>
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">In the Reading Settings, you can  choose between different types of view.  In flowed view, the text flows to fit the size of your device and chosen settings.  If you choose flowed view, you can also choose settings for the font size and the justification of text. </p>
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px; text-align:left;"><b>Fixed View</b></p>
<hr>
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">In fixed view, the pages appear just they do in the print version of the book, including text, images, and page layout.  So you can't change the font size or justification in this view.  In both fixed and flowed view, you can change the background page color.  You can also control whether one page or two pages display when the device is oriented to landscape.  Some books offer only fixed view, or only flowed view.</p> 
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">To zoom in to a set level, double-tap on the screen. To zoom in however much you want, touch thumb and forefinger to the screen and spread them apart.  Once zoomed, you can pan around the page by moving your finger on the screen.</p> 
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">You can change what happens when you tap the screen in fixed view via the Tap Advance setting.  The default is By Page.  When it is set to By Block, tapping on the right edge of the screen zooms to the next block of text.  Tapping on the left edge of the screen zooms to the previous block.  To zoom to a block, double tap on it.</p>   
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">
    Advancing by block is a good way to read a book in fixed layout on a small screen, such as an iPhone or iPod Touch.  Orient the device to landscape, and if necessary set the landscape setting to 1 Page.  When you're done reading the text on the screen, tapping on the right edge will scroll to the next screenful of text.</p>

<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px; text-align:left;"><b>Fast View</b></p>
<hr>
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">Pinch or spread your fingers to set your preferred text size.  Then touch the screen and hold your finger down to start.  The higher you touch, the faster the words change.</p> 
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">Try it!  Most people who do find that they can increase their reading speed, by an average of 33 percent.  This mode of reading makes it unnecessary to move your eye around the page, which is the leading cause of eyestrain.</p>
