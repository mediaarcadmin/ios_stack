<h1 class="chaptertitle">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
<p class="left"><b><em>I had the early shift</em></b> at Slim's the next day, which meant I should have gone to sleep immediately after the meeting. Instead, I lay awake thinking about what Ryan had said. Was it possible that my father was alive and well? Then, why hadn't he contacted us?</p>
<p class="follow">I must have finally fallen asleep, because I jerked awake when the alarm rang. I'd been having a marvelous dream, in which the entire Giordano family was reunited with my father.</p>
<p class="follow">I made it to Slim's on autopilot. Though I was barely awake, I managed to notice Flo's T-shirt, which read <span style="font-size: smaller">I AM THE EVIL TWIN.</span></p>
<p class="follow">Despite an extra-large latte, I was practically sleepwalking through the lunch rush.</p>
<p class="follow">Even Slim noticed. "Daisy, are you all right?"</p>
<p class="follow">I smothered a yawn. "Why do you ask?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Because you just put nuts in that salad. Mr. Webster ordered it without. He's allergic."</p>

<p class="follow">"Oh, my gosh!" I set the salad aside and started a new one. "It'll take me just a minute."</p>
<p class="follow">"It's okay," he said. A spatula pointed me toward the front. "Get yourself a cup of coffee. I can handle it for a bit."</p>
<p class="follow">I grabbed the largest coffee cup I could find and headed for the pot. My back was turned away from the door, but I heard it open and then Flo's gasp.</p>
<p class="follow">"Daisy, is that you?" There was something familiar about the voice. I turned as a tall dark-haired man in a suit approached the counter. I suppressed a gasp of my own. My father's face stared back at me. "Can I help you?"</p>
<p class="follow">"It's me, your father. Don't you recognize me?"</p>
<p class="follow">The jukebox kicked on. The song playing was "Lips Like Sugar" by Echo and the Bunnymen. Coincidence? I remembered the harpy had said that doppelgangers loved sugar.</p>
<p class="follow">Lil was definitely trying to tell me something. "How do I know you're my father?" I asked. He didn't look like the desperate guy who had been dumpster diving the other day. He was clean and well-dressed.</p>
<p class="follow">"The first thing you ever cooked was pancakes. And you burned them."</p>
<p class="follow">But he had eaten every bite, I remembered, and then taught me how to use the stove properly. I relaxed a little. I figured he would, too, if I got him some refreshments.</p>
<p class="follow">"Can I get you something?" Test number one.</p>

<p class="follow">"Black coffee, please."</p>
<p class="follow">"Would you like a donut with that?"</p>
<p class="follow">His eyes jittered to the display case, but his expression remained serene. "No, thanks. Just the coffee, please."</p>
<p class="follow">I bent under the counter, where we kept our coffee cups, and caught a whiff of his cologne. It sent a pang through me. It was a smell I'd never forget. Dreamer by Versace. Dad had worn it as long as I could remember.</p>
<p class="follow">I set the cup in front of him and poured it, then scooted the sugar container closer to him. He passed that test, too, when he carefully chose three packets of sugar and stirred them into his coffee. A tiny bloom of hope grew in my chest. That was exactly how my dad used to take his coffee. He used to let me put the sugar cubes in his cup for him when I was little.</p>
<p class="follow">"Where have you been? Why haven't you been in contact with us?"</p>
<p class="follow">"My memory is fuzzy," he replied. "I'm not sure exactly what happened. I guess I must have been unconscious ... And when I woke up, I was being dumped out of a van onto the beach here in Nightshade. I don't remember where I was or who I was with before that. I was so confused. I slept under the boardwalk and ate out of dumpsters for days. It took me a while, but I started to regain memories of my life in Nightshade. But there are still big gaps."</p>

<p class="follow">Amnesia? Or maybe his faulty memory was just a cover.</p>
<p class="follow">Before I had time to think about it, I was in his mind. I caught a glimpse of a tiny room without windows and a voice saying, "I'm not done with you yet." The memories whirled through my consciousness. He was knocked on the head and abducted. I jumped out of his mind when I started delving into his memories of when I was a kid. It hurt too much to remember how happy we were then.</p>
<p class="follow">His voice interrupted my rummaging in his memories. "You've grown up. I barely recognized you," he said. I wondered if he knew I had psychic powers. I doubted it. When I last saw him, I hadn't had any abilities.</p>
<p class="follow">I certainly didn't look the same as I did when I was twelve. But to me, he looked like the same old dad.</p>
<p class="follow">But if he remembered where he was held captive, why was he pretending he didn't?</p>
<p class="follow">Without thinking, I snapped, "It's not like the world stopped when you went away." I felt a pang of regret immediately after saying it. My long-standing bitterness about his absence was slipping out.</p>
<p class="follow">"No, of course not," he said softly. "How is your mother?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Why haven't you called her to tell her you're back? She's never changed her cell phone number." She didn't want to, just in case he somehow decided to contact her.</p>
<p class="follow">I realized that I was talking much too loudly when I saw Flo's face. She grabbed a rag and began wiping down the stainless steel, but I knew she was listening to every word.</p>
<p class="follow">He shrugged. "I told you, there are gaps in my memory. I don't remember her number. And besides, I heard she was in Italy for the summer. I'd rather just wait until she gets home so we can talk in person."</p>
<p class="follow">"But she's your wife," I said, trying to keep my voice down. To my amazement, he wasn't paying attention to me. He was staring at the clock behind me above the wall.</p>
<p class="follow">"Am I keeping you from something?" I said sarcastically.</p>
<p class="follow">"No, it's just, this isn't the place for this discussion. We'll talk later, at home." He carefully adjusted his wristwatch and, before I could speak, threw a bill on the counter and walked out.</p>
<p class="follow">Unbelievable.</p>
<p class="follow">"Was that your father?" Flo's voice broke into my thoughts.</p>
<p class="follow">"Apparently." But I wasn't sure. My memories of my father had faded over time. <em>Waitâ€”he said we'd talk at home?</em> I <em>really</em> needed to talk to Poppy and Rose.</p>
<p class="follow">I kept getting Rose's voice mail but reached Poppy and gave her a brief summary of the conversation I'd just had.</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy was supposed to pick me up after work, so we decided we'd head to the university after that. Rose was bound to be there; she'd been spending every extra minute at the lab lately.</p>
<p class="follow">I went back to the kitchen. The orders had backed up a little while I'd been chatting with ... who exactly? I thought about the identity of the person calling himself my father while I helped Slim cook, but I didn't find any answers.</p>
<p class="follow">After my shift finally ended, I told Poppy all about what had happened.</p>
<p class="follow">"Why didn't you make him wait until I could get there?" she asked.</p>
<p class="follow">"He took me by surprise. I wasn't expecting him to stroll into Slim's, you know. I'm not even sure it <em>was</em> Dad, especially not with all those doppelgangers running around town."</p>
<p class="follow">"What if it is?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Let's find Rose first. Then we'll figure out what to do."</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">When we got to the lab, it was locked up tight, but I could hear raised voices on the other side of the door. It sounded like they were arguing about something.</p>
<p class="follow">The knob turned and I stepped back as Mrs. Mason stormed out, with Dr. Franken at her heels.</p>
<p class="follow">"Come back here, Matilda!" Dr. Franken shouted, but Mrs. Mason ignored her and hurried down the hall and out of sight.</p>
<p class="follow">The professor's expression was unreadable, but I noticed that her hands clenched and unclenched rapidly. She didn't even notice us until Poppy peered into the lab's open doorway.</p>
<p class="follow">"Stay away from there," Dr. Franken said sharply. Then she recognized us and added, "Oh, I'm sorry. It's just that there's highly sensitive research in the lab. You're Rose's sisters, correct?"</p>

<p class="follow">"Yes, we'd like to speak to her if it's at all possible," Poppy said in a quietly respectful tone.</p>
<p class="follow">"Wait here, I'll go get Rose," she replied, then entered the lab and closed the door firmly behind her.</p>
<p class="follow">We cooled our heels in the hallway until Rose finally appeared, wearing her white lab coat.</p>
<p class="follow">"Is everything okay?" she asked.</p>
<p class="follow">"We need to talk to you. Privately."</p>
<p class="follow">"Daisy, I'm in the middle of something big. Can't it wait?"</p>
<p class="follow">"It's important," Poppy replied. "Really. But we can't talk here." I glanced at her. Was she as creeped out as I was by Dr. Franken?</p>
<p class="follow">Rose looked at her watch. "Meet me at the food court in half an hour."</p>
<p class="follow">"Rose, Rose?" Dr. Franken's voice called out. "Where is that girl?"</p>
<p class="follow">"I've got to get back," Rose said. "Half an hour." She didn't wait for an answer, but strode back into the lab without a backward glance.</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy and I walked to the student center. There were quite a few more people on campus today, including, evidently, good-looking frat boys. Poppy guy-watched appreciatively.</p>
<p class="follow">When we got to the food court, I ordered an extra-large vanilla latte for me and sodas for Poppy and Rose.</p>
<p class="follow">Rose rushed in about forty-five minutes later, after Poppy had managed to finish her soda and order another one, plus an order of onion rings.</p>

<p class="follow">"I can only stay for a minute," Rose said. "Something set Dr. Franken off this morning and she's in a tizzy. I don't dare stay too long." She grabbed an onion ring. "I'm starving. I didn't have time for lunch today."</p>
<p class="follow">She looked from Poppy to me expectantly.</p>
<p class="follow">There was no good way to break the news. "Dad's in town," I said. "I had a visit from him at Slim's today."</p>
<p class="follow">Rose's mouth dropped open. "You mean it's really him?"</p>
<p class="follow">"I don't know," I admitted. "But I think he's going to move in. He said he'd see me at the house later."</p>
<p class="follow">Rose looked at her watch. "I know Dr. Franken needs me, but I can't let you two go back there alone," she said. "I'll just have to call her and tell her I had a family emergency and I need to take off the rest of the day."</p>
<p class="follow">"Do you think it could really be Dad?" Poppy asked after Rose made her call. There was a tiny bit of hope in Poppy's voice.</p>
<p class="follow">"It could be, but we should wait to tell Mom until we're sure. There's no sense in getting her all upset if it turns out it's not even him."</p>
<p class="follow">"So what should we do in the meantime?" I asked as we hurried to the car.</p>
<p class="follow">"We'll go home and entertain him, whoever he is," Rose said. "And we'll try to find out who he really is. We can't get too close to him before we know for sure."</p>
<p class="follow">"This feels wrong," Poppy said. "If he's our dad, we should be welcoming him home with open arms."</p>

<p class="follow">Rose thought for a moment. "We'll tell him that we need time to reacquaint ourselves with him. Break it to him gently."</p>
<p class="follow">But it turned out we didn't have to worry about the right way to tell him. When we got home, the house was empty. It looked like our father had vanished again.</p>
