<h1 class="chaptertitle">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<p class="left"><b><em>When the alarm rang</em></b> bright and early the next morning, I almost rolled over and hit the <b>snooze</b> button. Jet lag was finally catching up with me, and I had stayed up too late watching movies with Ryan—well, mostly watching movies. But since I'd never seen the elusive Slim and I really did want a summer job, I forced my eyelids open and went downstairs to put on a pot of coffee. Coffee and good chocolate were the two things in life I found necessary to function properly.</p>
<p class="follow">After a quick shower, I threw on what I thought would be interview-appropriate clothing: navy cotton dress pants and a white shirt. I thought my usual summer flip-flops would be a little too casual, so I rooted through my closet until I found some closed-toe sandals. I braided my hair in a single plait and grabbed the keys. I didn't forget to bring along the notebook I had to send my mom, which I figured I'd mail after my interview.</p>
<p class="follow">It was still dark out when I left the house. Main Street looked deserted, but you could never tell what might be lurking in the shadows in Nightshade. The lights were on at Slim's and the Donut Hole, the new donut shop across the street. My mouth watered, but there was no time to grab a quick sugar fix. I needed to get to my interview.</p>
<p class="follow">I had my pick of parking spots, so I pulled into one right in front of Slim's. As I got out of the car, Mr. Krayson, my statistics teacher, exited the donut shop, stuffing donuts in his mouth as fast as he could.</p>
<p class="follow">"Hi, Mr. Krayson," I called out. He didn't answer, or even act like he heard me, but continued to chew. Little chunks of jelly donuts sprayed everywhere, but he didn't seem to notice. Gross.</p>
<p class="follow">I shrugged. He was always on a diet. Maybe he was embarrassed to be seen eating so many donuts.</p>
<p class="follow">The door to Slim's was locked so I tapped on the glass. It opened, seemingly of its own volition. I stepped into an empty restaurant. I'd been there a million times, but the utter silence spooked me a little. Flo had said Slim would be here at five, but there was no sign of him.</p>
<p class="follow">"Hello?" I said. "Is anybody here?" There was no reply.</p>
<p class="follow">This was the weirdest job interview I'd ever been on. Granted, I'd never had a job interview before, but I was pretty sure there was supposed to be another person involved.</p>
<p class="follow">I wandered into the back, getting a secret thrill from treading forbidden territory. I loved to cook, and Slim's spotless and orderly kitchen met with my full approval.</p>
<p class="follow">There was a row of shiny knives on the counter, along with a cutting board. I stepped closer and examined the knives. They were Global knives, favorites with professional chefs. My hands itched to use them. I ran a finger along one of the blades. Honed to perfection.</p>
<p class="follow">"Hello?" I said again, but there was still no answer. Slim's was due to open any minute and it looked like Slim had left in the middle of preparation. I washed my hands and decided I'd make a pot of coffee while I waited. The enormous vat of a coffeemaker was in the front wait station. Coffee and filters were already in the machine, so all I had to do was press a button.</p>
<p class="follow">I snooped around some more and found a pan of cinnamon rolls proofing near the oven.</p>
<p class="follow"><em>They need to go in the oven soon, or they'll overproof.</em> I had picked up a stray thought—which sometimes happened even when I wasn't trying to read someone's mind—and then looked around. I wasn't alone, but I couldn't for the life of me figure out where the person could be hiding.</p>
<p class="follow">I checked the temperature and then slid them into the oven and set the timer.</p>
<p class="follow">That finished, I went to check the coffee. It was ready, so I poured myself a cup, added lots of cream and sugar, and went back to the kitchen.</p>
<p class="follow">Where was Slim? Was he hiding somewhere, watching my every move? It was spooking me out.</p>
<p class="follow"><em>The specials are veggie omelets and banana pancakes.</em> Another hint from my mysterious observer, wherever he was. By now, I was almost sure that it was Slim who was my silent watcher.</p>
<p class="follow">I could have chopped the veggies using my telepathic skills, especially since Poppy was always nagging me to practice, but I wanted to try out those knives. And besides, I had a sneaking suspicion a real cook might consider that cheating. A lot of people in Nightshade already knew I was psychic, but there was no need to advertise it. I'd do the work the old-fashioned way.</p>
<p class="follow">The knives chopped like a dream, but I was careful. I'd stop working intermittently, to look over my shoulder. I could still sense a presence. Besides, I didn't want to get blood all over that pristine kitchen.</p>
<p class="follow">When the vegetables were chopped, I washed my hands again, then started on the pancake batter. That finished, I wiped down the counters and cleaned all the utensils I'd used.</p>
<p class="follow">I'd done as much as I could when the timer for the cinnamon rolls rang off. I found a couple of oven mitts and took the rolls out of the oven. I almost dropped the whole tray when a masculine voice said, "You're hired."</p>
<p class="follow">I turned around, but there was nobody there.</p>
<p class="follow">"I'm sorry," I said. "Did somebody say something?"</p>
<p class="follow">"I said," the voice continued, "that you're hired. You're looking for a job, right?"</p>
<p class="follow">Still no sign of anyone else on the premises. "Are you a ghost?"</p>

<p class="follow">The voice sounded amused now. "Flo said you were an intelligent girl. I'm not a ghost."</p>
<p class="follow">"Invisible?" I guessed again.</p>
<p class="follow">"Very good," he said. Invisible hands clapped.</p>
<p class="follow">"I'm Daisy," I said. "And you are...?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Slim," the man said. "Not my real name, of course. Just one of Florence's little jokes. Griffin is my given name, but you can call me Slim. Everyone does."</p>
<p class="follow">
<em>Florence? Flo's real name is Florence?</em>
</p>
<p class="follow">"My younger sister has a somewhat unusual sense of humor," the voice continued. "Florence will be in shortly, but in the meantime, I expect Officer Denton and his lovely fiancé will be wanting their breakfast. Be a dear and let them in."</p>
<p class="follow">Slim was Flo's brother? Nightshade really was full of secrets. Now that I thought about it, I didn't really know much about Flo, despite the fact that I'd been coming to Slim's for years.</p>
<p class="follow">"Was this some sort of test?" I said as I set the cinnamon rolls on the counter. I felt relieved that I didn't have to answer a bunch of questions. I had been geared up for the <em>What do you think are your greatest strengths?</em> question.</p>
<p class="follow">In reply, a ring of keys was tossed in the air. I caught it on reflex but then stood there, mouth agape, until Slim cleared his throat.</p>
<p class="follow">I went to the front of the restaurant and found Officer Denton and his fiancé at the door, just as Slim had said they'd be.</p>

<p class="follow">I unlocked the door and let them in. "Good morning, Daisy," Officer Denton said. "I didn't know you worked here."</p>
<p class="follow">"I didn't, either," I said, under my breath.</p>
<p class="follow">After I took their orders, I went to the kitchen, not sure what to do next.</p>
<p class="follow">"Uh, I need two orders of banana pancakes, with pecans," I said to the air.</p>
<p class="follow">"You'll find an order pad and some pens in that drawer," Slim said.</p>
<p class="follow">"Which drawer?"</p>
<p class="follow">"My apologies," Slim said. A second later, a knife floated into the air and then pointed in the general direction of the correct drawer.</p>
<p class="follow">I grabbed the pad and wrote out the order, then hung it on the little wheel thingie I'd seen Flo use a million times before.</p>
<p class="follow">Gradually, more people started to filter in. A couple of coffee drinkers at the counter I could handle, but when the booths started to fill up, I began to panic. But I didn't have time to worry as I ran around getting orange juice and coffee, taking orders, and generally losing my mind.</p>
<p class="follow">Where was Flo? About ten seconds from meltdown, she strolled in.</p>
<p class="follow">"Where have you been?" I panted.</p>
<p class="follow">"Sorry," she said. "I was ... unavoidably detained. Did you work everything out with Slim?"</p>

<p class="follow">"Not exactly," I replied. "He just told me I was hired, and pointed me toward the customers."</p>
<p class="follow">"He must like you," she said.</p>
<p class="follow">"Flo, a little service here," called one of the regulars.</p>
<p class="follow">For the next hour and a half, I worked harder than I'd ever worked in my life. When the breakfast rush finally calmed down, I collapsed on a barstool at the counter.</p>
<p class="follow">"Why don't you take a break, Daisy?" Flo said. "Have a soda or cup of coffee. I can handle it for now."</p>
<p class="follow">"Thanks," I said. "I could use something to drink."</p>
<p class="follow">"Coffee's on the house," Flo said, as she waved my money away.</p>
<p class="follow">"I need to call my sisters," I said. "I told them I had an interview, but they're probably wondering where the heck I've been this whole time."</p>
<p class="follow">I called home, but when the machine picked up, I just left a message.</p>
<p class="follow">Then I took my caffeine and went to sit outside for a few minutes. My feet hurt and I could feel a blister forming on my heel. I hadn't planned on working in the shoes I'd worn to my interview.</p>
<p class="follow">I saw Miss McBennett, who worked at the post office and had to be nearly eighty. She was going into the donut shop. I waved, but she seemed to be in a hurry to get her donuts. Those donuts must be something—better than Krispy Kreme donuts, if that was even possible.</p>

<p class="follow">Seeing Miss McBennett reminded me that I had to mail that package to my mom, so I told Flo I'd be right back and walked around the corner to the post office. Sitting there behind the counter was none other than ... Miss McBennett?</p>
<p class="follow">How could that be? I was sure that it was her I'd seen not five minutes before, going into the Donut Hole. I didn't think an eighty-year-old woman—not even my grandma, who walked three miles every day—could make it there and back that quickly.</p>
<p class="follow">"Daisy? Can I help you?" Miss McBennett asked, seeing me standing there with a confused look on my face. "Is something wrong?"</p>
<p class="follow">I collected myself. "Didn't I just see you at the donut shop?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Goodness, no," Miss McBennett said. "I didn't live this long by eating junk food. I've never been to that donut shop and I don't plan to go."</p>
<p class="follow">"Oh. I guess it must have been someone who just looked a lot like you," I said. After mailing the package, I wanted to stop at the Donut Hole and see if the Miss McBennett look-alike was still there, but I figured I'd better get back to work.</p>
<p class="follow">Turned out I didn't need to hurry. When I got back to Slim's, the place was nearly empty. I took a seat next to Flo at the counter.</p>
<p class="follow">"What should I do next?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Relax," she said. "Everything's under control for now."</p>
<p class="follow">"What will my hours be?" I asked Flo.</p>

<p class="follow">"We really need help on the weekends," she said. "But you might need to fill in during the week, too."</p>
<p class="follow">Weekends? When would I see Ryan? He had practice almost every day, and if I had to work nights, I'd never see him.</p>
<p class="follow">"Mornings or evenings?" I asked. I didn't have to say yes, I reminded myself.</p>
<p class="follow">To my relief, Flo said, "Mornings, especially Saturdays. As early as you can get here. You'll be pitching in with whatever—waiting tables, kitchen prep, maybe even cooking."</p>
<p class="follow">I didn't want to be one of those girls whose life completely revolved around her boyfriend, but I was glad I'd have some time to spend with Ryan.</p>
<p class="follow">Another question occurred to me. "And what should I wear?"</p>
<p class="follow">Flo shrugged. "We don't have a dress code here. Obviously."</p>
<p class="follow">I glanced at her T-shirt, which had <span style="font-size: smaller">WOMEN WHO PAY THEIR OWN RENT DON'T HAVE TO BE NICE</span> on the front. Obviously, indeed.</p>
<p class="follow">"Just wear the kind of thing you usually wear," Flo said. 'And Slim will give you an apron."</p>
<p class="follow">A minute later, the entire football team walked into Slim's. The jukebox stopped and suddenly went into "Leader of the Pack" by the Shangri-Las. Very funny.</p>
<p class="follow">Ryan's face lit up when he saw me. "I was just going to call you to see if you wanted to meet us here for lunch. Samantha and some of the other cheerleaders are on the way."</p>

<p class="follow">I explained that I'd be working there, and then got busy taking their orders.</p>
<p class="follow">Bane Paxton's little brother, Wolfgang, grabbed my arm. "Hey, cutie, what's your name?"</p>
<p class="follow">Ryan growled low in his throat, but I sent him a look to let him know I could handle a freshman.</p>
<p class="follow">"Let go of me if you want to keep that hand," I said, smiling politely.</p>
<p class="follow">Bane's brother said, "Hey, I saw the way you were looking at me. You like what you see, right? Wanna taste of lupine love?"</p>
<p class="follow">He said it under his breath, but Sean heard him. "In your dreams, Wolfgang," Sean said. "She's Ryan's girlfriend, hairball, so I'm guessing she was looking at him, not at some freshman squid who isn't even on the football team."</p>
<p class="follow">Wolfgang had a mop of bushy black hair, which stood up in every direction and smelled musty like he'd been left in a damp room too long. Not my type at all, even if I wasn't so into Ryan.</p>
<p class="follow">The tension ratcheted up a notch.</p>
<p class="follow">Ryan said, "And if you don't take your hands off her—"</p>
<p class="follow">"What?" the guy said, but he removed his hand from my wrist. A minute later, he got up and went to the jukebox.</p>
<p class="follow">I stared after him for a moment." When did Bane's little brother turn into such a pain?" I said. Bane Paxton was in Poppy's graduating class and dated Elise Wilder. Like the Wilders, the Paxtons were shifters. I knew from my experience with Ryan that teenage werewolves could get a little aggressive sometimes, but Wolfgang seemed to be extra jerky. My wrist ached where he had grabbed me.</p>
<p class="follow">"He's got a chip on his shoulder," Ryan said. "He didn't make the team. If he tries anything..."</p>
<p class="follow">"He won't," I said. "Besides, I can take care of myself."</p>
<p class="follow">A group of Nightshade High cheerleaders came into the restaurant. They pulled up a table next to the football players, and suddenly the rush was on again.</p>
<p class="follow">Flo took pity on me and helped me out. My classmates were not going easy on me just because it was my first day, although Rachel was gentle when she pointed out that she had ordered the salad and Sean was the one who'd ordered the double-deluxe extra rare cheeseburger with fries.</p>
<p class="follow">Wolfgang had disappeared, so I decided it was safe to invite everyone to the party. It would save me making a bunch of phone calls. "Hey, Samantha," I said. "We're having a beach party on Saturday."</p>
<p class="follow">Rachel's head swiveled around. "Everyone's invited," I said, and smiled at her. I really liked Rachel, even though we had the same taste in guys.</p>
<p class="follow">The diner emptied out a couple of hours later.</p>
<p class="follow">Finally, the day was over and I grabbed an iced latte and sat on a stool at the counter. It had been hours since I'd had any caffeine or chocolate, two dietary essentials in my book.</p>

<p class="follow">"How do you do it?" I asked Flo.</p>
<p class="follow">"You get used to it," Flo replied. "Go home and soak your feet. And buy some shoes with good arch support."</p>
<p class="follow">I went home and soaked my feet as Flo had suggested, but I didn't know that it would be my last moment of peace for the next few weeks. My life was about to get much more complicated. So complicated that aching feet were the least of my worries.</p>
