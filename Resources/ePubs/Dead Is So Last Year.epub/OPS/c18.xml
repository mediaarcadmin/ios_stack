<h1 class="chaptertitle"><a id='bliopage150'/>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1>
<p class="left"><b><em>Mrs. Mason's funeral</em></b> was held early in the morning a few days later. Slim asked my sisters and me to attend. Grandma came with us, but there was no sign of our father figure. Word of Mrs. Mason's involvement in the doppelganger scare had spread and the paranormal community avoided her burial.</p>
<p class="follow">The service was held at Mort's, of course, but besides my family, and Nicholas and his dad, who kind of had to be there, only Ryan and his dad showed.</p>
<p class="follow">"Daisy, thanks so much for coming," Natalie said. She gave me a hug. It looked like she'd been crying for days.</p>
<p class="follow">Natalie was surprisingly composed during the service, but when it was time to leave, she broke down and Slim led her away.</p>
<p class="follow">"What will she do now?" I asked Chief Mendez.</p>
<p class="follow">"Slim will take care of her," he said. "Natalie didn't do anything wrong."</p>
<p class="follow">"But that hasn't stopped the paranormal community from <a id='bliopage151'/>avoiding her," I said. "Bad or good, Natalie loved her grandmother." It wasn't fair.</p>
<p class="follow">Ryan put his arm around me." We won't avoid her."</p>
<p class="follow">I smiled and leaned in to him. "You're the best."</p>
<p class="follow">Ryan came over afterward and we made a cake to take over to Slim's later. It was the only thing I could think of to show Natalie that we wouldn't abandon her.</p>
<p class="follow">It took a tragedy to make it happen, but things were back to normal with me and Ryan. He forgave me for lying about DoppelDad. After all, all bets were off when it came to family. Ryan even admitted to me that he would have probably done the same thing if his mom—or a doppelganger of her—showed up at his house.</p>
<p class="follow">I was surprised when DoppelDad showed up at our house again late that afternoon, after Ryan had left for football practice. DoppelDad had to knock this time, since we had the locks changed. I didn't know where he'd been, but there were rumors of him being spotted with various gorgeous young women (although, thankfully, not Natalie) all over town.</p>
<p class="follow">"Hi," I said cautiously.</p>
<p class="follow">"I heard you're going through some tough times," he said. "I thought we might spend some time together."</p>
<p class="follow">I toyed with the idea of slamming the door in his face after what he'd done to Rose, or of calling Chief Mendez, but the desperation in his voice tugged at my heartstrings. He was dressed <a id='bliopage152'/>as my father might have been on a Saturday afternoon: khaki shorts, a faded T-shirt, and a UC Nightshade hooded sweatshirt. Sometimes it was still hard to believe that I wasn't really looking at my own father.</p>
<p class="follow">"Want to walk to the beach?" I asked, figuring it would be safer to talk to him in public.</p>
<p class="follow">"Sure," he said.</p>
<p class="follow">It was a long walk, but the idea was to get him to talk. And besides, Poppy was working at the Snack Shack, so she'd be there for reinforcement, if needed.</p>
<p class="follow">We walked in silence, but finally my curiosity got the better of me. "Where have you been lately?"</p>
<p class="follow">"With a friend," he replied.</p>
<p class="follow">Not exactly forthcoming.</p>
<p class="follow">We finally reached the beach. It was the middle of summer and we'd have an audience. Half of Nightshade, the non-nocturnal half, was at the beach.</p>
<p class="follow">It didn't seem to bother DoppelDad, though. He smiled pleasantly at everyone who greeted him by my father's name.</p>
<p class="follow">The whispers and stares didn't seem to bother him, but they were definitely getting to me.</p>
<p class="follow">"I'll get us something from the snack bar," I offered. "What would you like?"</p>
<p class="follow">He clapped his hands like a little kid. "Do they have cotton candy?"</p>
<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage153'/>"I'm sure they do. Wait here. I'll be right back."</p>
<p class="follow">He settled on a bench with a clear view of the water while I went to get the snacks.</p>
<p class="follow">The Snack Shack was busy and Poppy couldn't really talk. So I made it quick.</p>
<p class="follow">"DoppelDad's here," I said.</p>
<p class="follow">"Has he said anything about where he's been?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Not really. He wants cotton candy."</p>
<p class="follow">"Hmm. That's what Mrs. Wilder's doppelganger gobbled down," Poppy said.</p>
<p class="follow">"I know, spooky, huh?"</p>
<p class="follow">"I dunno," she said. "Everyone likes cotton candy in the summer. We've been selling tons of it. It can't all be to doppelgangers." She handed me the sticky treat. "Anything else?"</p>
<p class="follow">"A chocolate-dipped cone?"</p>
<p class="follow">I handed her my money, and she said, "Daisy?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Can you guys hang until I can take a break? Just so I can say hi?"</p>
<p class="follow">The note of yearning made me ashamed of myself about suspecting him. For Poppy's sake, I hoped he <em>was</em> our dad. So our dad wasn't perfect. I tried not to let it bother me that our real dad might be a player. That didn't mean he didn't love us. Did it?</p>
<p class="follow">Besides, people changed and he'd been held captive all those <a id='bliopage154'/>years. No wonder he wanted to kick up his heels a little. That didn't mean he was cheating on Mom.</p>
<p class="follow">"Of course! We'll hang out until your break."</p>
<p class="follow">As I walked back, I heard Samantha calling my name. She waved at me from a bright pink beach towel, so I cut through the sand to go say hi.</p>
<p class="follow">I was halfway there when I noticed that she was accompanied by Sean and several of his new and obnoxious buddies from the football team.</p>
<p class="follow">"Daisy, want to join us?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Uh, no, thanks. I'm with someone." I took a lick of my chocolate cone.</p>
<p class="follow">Wolfgang snorted gleefully and I turned and glared at him.</p>
<p class="follow">My ire didn't seem to faze Wolfie at all. "Trolling for dates?" he asked.</p>
<p class="follow">I glared at him.</p>
<p class="follow">Sean nudged him and said, "Let's go throw the ball. See ya, Daisy."</p>
<p class="follow">He wouldn't meet my eyes and I could understand why. I wouldn't want to be seen with Wolfgang Paxton, either, especially not after the way he acted at the movies.</p>
<p class="follow">I wondered if Ryan knew that Sean was still hanging out with Wolfie.</p>
<p class="follow">After they left, I turned to Samantha." I can't stand not knowing for sure if that guy is my father."</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage155'/>I pointed to where he stood ogling Mrs. Justus, who was smokin' hot and <em>almost</em> age appropriate.</p>
<p class="follow">"Just hang in there until you guys figure out what's going on," she said. "Have you talked to the council?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Not officially," I said. "But Rose has been updating Nicholas and his father."</p>
<p class="follow">"Why haven't the council acted?" she asked.</p>
<p class="follow">" There's not much else they can do. They know that Mrs. Mason was the one who created the doubles, but they think she had help. There's someone following the doppelgangers around in the hopes that it'll eventually lead to whoever was helping her."</p>
<p class="follow">We were silent for a minute. We watched as Wolfgang purposefully tripped one of his cronies and rubbed sand in his face.</p>
<p class="follow">"Why is Sean hanging out with that guy? He's a creep."</p>
<p class="follow">"He's okay," she said. "A little aggressive, maybe."</p>
<p class="follow">"A little?" I said incredulously. "He's a menace."</p>
<p class="follow">As if to prove my point, Wolfgang threw the football right at a couple of little harpy kids. If you looked really closely, you could see the nubs of their baby wings. The youngest started to cry, and her older brother, who was barely old enough to toddle, extended his claws and glared at Wolfie, who just laughed.</p>
<p class="follow">"Why is he such a jerk?" I asked.</p>
<p class="follow">Samantha avoided my eyes. "I don't know," she said. "Sean's my boyfriend, but it's not like I can tell him who to be friends with."</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage156'/>"I know," I said, "but Wolfgang is so obnoxious. Just look at him. Next he'll be kicking sand in the faces of little old ladies."</p>
<p class="follow">Sam sighed." I don't know what to do," she admitted." Sean won't listen to me. He's been really moody lately and hardly has any time for me."</p>
<p class="follow">I was surprised by this. Samantha was gorgeous, one of the most popular girls in school, and she had Sean wrapped around her little finger.</p>
<p class="follow">"Give him some time," I advised. "But try to get him to spend less time with Wolfie. Maybe you and Sean and Ryan and I can go out again soon? We haven't done that in ages."</p>
<p class="follow">"I'd like that," she said.</p>
<p class="follow">"I've got to get back," I said, nodding toward where <em>he</em> still sat on the bench.</p>
<p class="follow">I wandered back over and handed DoppelDad an enormous mound of cotton candy. I expected him to gulp it down, but instead, he tore off a strip and offered it to me.</p>
<p class="follow">"No thanks."</p>
<p class="follow">He shrugged and popped it into his mouth."Were those your friends?"</p>
<p class="follow">I shrugged. "Some of them. Would you like something else?" I asked. "Poppy works at the Snack Shack, over there." I pointed to the stand.</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy saw us and took off her apron before heading our way. "I'm taking a break," she called to her coworkers before she left the shack.</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage157'/>I wandered a little, to give her some time alone with DoppelDad. When I came back, they were sitting at a picnic table and DoppelDad had a cup of soft serve ice cream in front of him.</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy bounded over to meet me. "It is him, I'm sure of it," she crowed. "It's Dad."</p>
<p class="follow">"But Poppy, we talked about this—"</p>
<p class="follow">"But he was being so nice just now," she said. "Just like Dad used to be. He even said he'd talk to Dr. Franken about getting Rose her job back."</p>
<p class="follow">"If he was our real dad, he never would have gotten her fired in the first place," I snapped.</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy was grasping at straws. "Well, how else would he have known about my hair?" she challenged.</p>
<p class="follow">"Remember, doppelgangers retain memories of the original. Besides, there are always family photos, school yearbook, a million possibilities."</p>
<p class="follow">"Stop it, Daisy. I'm beginning to think you don't want him to be Dad. That you don't want him to come home. Well, I do."</p>
<p class="follow">So did I, more than anything. But I couldn't bear the disappointment if he turned out to be a phony.</p>
<p class="follow">I sighed. "We've got to prove this once and for all," I said. "I'm going to invite him over for dinner."</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy brightened. "That's a great idea, Daisy!"</p>
<p class="follow">I lowered my voice. "And then when he shows up, we're going to have Chief Mendez come over and take him away for testing."</p>
<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage158'/>Poppy's face fell. "You can't, Daisy!" she said. "You can't let them put our father in a cage like they did to Miss McBennett at the council meeting."</p>
<p class="follow">"That wasn't Miss McBennett. That was her doppelganger," I gently reminded her. "And if this guy is a doppelganger, this will just prove it. If not, no harm done."</p>
<p class="follow">"You promise that they won't hurt him?" Poppy said.</p>
<p class="follow">"Chief Mendez gave me his word," I said.</p>
<p class="follow">Finally, Poppy agreed that it was the only solution. She returned to work and I strode back to DoppelDad.</p>
<p class="follow">"Hey, Dad, would you like to come over for dinner?" I asked, with my best fake smile on.</p>
<p class="follow">He looked a little taken aback. "Uh, sure," he said. "When?"</p>
<p class="follow">"How's tomorrow night?"</p>
<p class="follow">"No good. I have other plans."</p>
<p class="follow">My anger started boiling up but I kept it under control. "Okay, the next night, then," I said sweetly. "We can even make the meal together, just like we used to do."</p>
<p class="follow">DoppelDad accepted the invitation, then made a hasty exit when he spotted an ice cream truck approaching.</p>
