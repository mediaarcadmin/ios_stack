<h1 class="chaptertitle">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>
<p class="left"><b><em>I had to work</em></b> at Slim's the next day, as well. When I got there, the lights were off and the front door was still locked. Not like Slim at all. If he was going to be late, he always made sure to call me or he asked me ahead of time to cover for him.</p>
<p class="follow">I went around to the back door and was alarmed to find that it was wide open. I entered cautiously, but there was no sign of a break-in or any damage. There was also no sign of Slim. It was hard enough to tell if he was around during the best of times, but how exactly did you look for someone you couldn't see?</p>
<p class="follow">"Slim?" I called, wondering if this was another test. I quickly dismissed the idea. The ovens were cold and the counters were empty. Slim would never mess with the diner's schedule, and as my watch told me, there was less than half an hour before the diner was supposed to open.</p>
<p class="follow">I went to the tiny office, found an employee phone list, and dialed Slim's number. There was a pile of candy wrappers on the desk, next to the phone.</p>

<p class="follow">I let it ring several times, but Slim didn't pick up. Would it kill him to join the twenty-first century and get an answering machine?</p>
<p class="follow">Finally, in desperation, I dialed Flo's cell.</p>
<p class="follow">"What?" Flo sounded cranky and I couldn't blame her. She wasn't due in for hours.</p>
<p class="follow">"It's Daisy. Sorry to wake you, but Slim's not at the diner this morning and nothing's been prepped. I can handle the kitchen, but I'm worried about him."</p>
<p class="follow">She sighed. "I'll be right in. And Daisy, don't worry about him. I'm sure he's just fine." There was an edge in her voice. She hung up without saying goodbye, but I couldn't really blame her. She'd worked the late shift the night before. What was going on with Slim? And why wasn't Flo more worried about him?</p>
<p class="follow">I didn't have time to analyze the situation. The restaurant had to open.</p>
<p class="follow">I hurried back to the kitchen and examined the specials board. There wasn't enough time to prepare the vegetable quiche Slim had planned. I wiped the board clean and printed <span style="font-size: smaller">VEGETABLE OMELET</span> under <span style="font-size: smaller">SPECIALS.</span></p>
<p class="follow">Our regulars would start a riot if we didn't serve Slim's melt-in-your-mouth cinnamon rolls. I fired up the oven and crossed my fingers that we had enough dough.</p>
<p class="follow">When I went to the refrigerator to check, it was wide open, and food containers were strewn all over the floor, including the pan with today's cinnamon rolls. There were only a few globs of dough left on it.</p>
<p class="follow">I had barely processed what the mess meant, when in the next room, the jukebox sprang to life, blasting the Archies' "Sugar, Sugar." My heart began to pound. Was someone in the restaurant?</p>
<p class="follow">I grabbed a knife and crept to the dining room, staying low, to hide behind the counter. Despite the loud music, I could hear a rustling at the end of the counter. I crouched lower and squeezed into a little nook beside the icemaker, where I wouldn't be seen during what I was sure must be a robbery in progress.</p>
<p class="follow">From where I crouched, I could see the lower half of the intruder's body. He looked like a big guy. His shoes looked familiar. His pants, too. Ryan's dad always wore shoes and pants like that. Those were cop clothes.</p>
<p class="follow">Feeling a little safer, I edged out of my hiding place and stood up. I was shocked to see Deputy Denton single-handedly consuming all the goodies in Slim's rotating dessert display case.</p>
<p class="follow">He saw me and dropped a gloopy handful of lemon meringue pie. He tried to speak but his mouth was full. I knew right away that I'd have to use a different kind of weapon against this intruder.</p>
<p class="follow">Luckily, the police station was right across the street. I grabbed a sugar shaker from the counter and approached the Deputy Denton look-alike, brandishing the sugar in front of him. He stared at it as if hypnotized.</p>

<p class="follow">I poured the sugar on the floor and moved backward toward the door. Deputy Doppelganger followed the trail, only pausing to grab a handful of mints from the bowl next to the cash register on his way out.</p>
<p class="follow">I kept the sugar trail going across the street, which, fortunately, was not busy at that early hour. When we entered the police station, Chief Mendez looked up from his desk.</p>
<p class="follow">"Daisy? Deputy Denton?" he said, looking confused.</p>
<p class="follow">"That isn't Deputy Denton," I said, holding up the sugar shaker. "It's a doppelganger."</p>
<p class="follow">The chief moved to grab the doppelganger before he could getaway."I knew there was something wrong when Deputy Denton came into work so early this morning and took the master keys."</p>
<p class="follow">I blushed. I knew the keys the chief was talking about. They opened every door in town, and Ryan and I had used them a few times to get into places we weren't supposed to be. That explained how Deputy Doppelganger had gotten into Slim's.</p>
<p class="follow">Chief Mendez plucked the keys out of the offender's pocket and led him back to the small station's single holding cell.</p>
<p class="follow">"Thanks, Daisy," the chief said when the doppelganger was locked up tight. "You did a great job getting him here."</p>
<p class="follow">"No problem," I said, then looked at my watch. <em>Yikes.</em> "I'd better get back to work."</p>
<p class="follow">As I hurried toward the door, I passed the real Deputy Denton on his way into work. His eyes widened when he saw his double in the holding cell. "What the..."</p>
<p class="follow">I didn't stop to explain. I had a lot of cleaning up to do at Slim's.</p>
<p class="follow">Back at the diner, I scrambled to sweep up the dessert-splattered floor. Luckily, there was some extra dough for cinnamon rolls in the back of the fridge that the doppelganger hadn't discovered, so I quickly prepped the rolls and slid them in to bake. I chopped vegetables for the omelets, then hurried to the front to start a pot of coffee.</p>
<p class="follow">I tried to remember what else to do to prepare for the breakfast rush, but my mind was blank. Slim was usually there to walk me through it.</p>
<p class="follow">I checked my watch again. When was Flo going to get here? I cringed when I saw a line of customers outside the front door already waiting for the restaurant to open.</p>
<p class="follow">It was like a bad dream. All I needed now was for Wolfgang and the football team or the cheerleaders to show up and my day would be complete.</p>
<p class="follow">I checked the clock over the cash register. There was no help for it; it was time to open. To my surprise, Mrs. Mason, Natalie's grandmother, was first in line.</p>
<p class="follow">"Quit dilly-dallying, girl, and get me some coffee," she barked as I unlocked the door and turned the sign to <span style="font-size: smaller">OPEN.</span></p>
<p class="follow">"It-it's not ready yet," I stuttered.</p>

<p class="follow">"Why not? Young people have no sense of responsibility these days."</p>
<p class="follow">"Ease up on Daisy, Mrs. Mason," Flo said, as she slipped inside, behind the older woman. "Slim didn't show up this morning."</p>
<p class="follow">Mrs. Mason didn't answer, but I noticed her chilly expression thawed a bit. "Is my granddaughter here this morning?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Not yet," Flo answered, "but I expect she'll meet Slim for breakfast."</p>
<p class="follow">As if on cue, Natalie strolled in and gave everyone a bright smile. "Good morning, everyone." But then she spotted her grandmother and her spine slumped. "Grandmother, what are you doing here?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Is that any way to greet your own flesh and blood?" Mrs. Mason replied. "I came here to speak to you, since you do not have the decency to return my calls."</p>
<p class="follow">"I thought Natalie lived with her grandma," I whispered to Flo.</p>
<p class="follow">"They had a fight, so she's been spending a lot of time with Slim," Flo replied.</p>
<p class="follow">Mrs. Mason said, "I'd like a cinnamon roll when you two are done gossiping."</p>
<p class="follow">"The cinnamon rolls aren't done yet," I told Flo. "What are we going to do?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Improvise," she said. And that's exactly what we did. I managed to keep Mrs. Mason happy by promising her a free cinnamon roll, once they came out of the oven.</p>

<p class="follow">About an hour later, I was in the kitchen, taking out the second batch of rolls, when I heard the back door open, and then Slim's cheerful whistling filled the kitchen.</p>
<p class="follow">"Daisy, you're a lifesaver," he said. "Could I trouble you for a cup of coffee from the front?"</p>
<p class="follow">I nearly dropped the pan. "Sure, Slim."</p>
<p class="follow">"I'll frost the rolls while you do that. Extra cream, please."</p>
<p class="follow">I hurried to the front, where Flo was manning the cash register.</p>
<p class="follow">"He's here," I said. "And he's <em>whistling."Slim</em> was not a whistler.</p>
<p class="follow">"Did he say anything?" she asked me as she handed change to the customer. We kept our eyes focused on his back as he exited the restaurant, but I knew we were both dying to stare in the direction of the kitchen. Invisible man or not, my curiosity was killing me. Where had Slim been and why was he so cheerful?</p>
<p class="follow">"Just thanks and that he'd like a cup of coffee."</p>
<p class="follow">"Slim's back?" That from Natalie.</p>
<p class="follow">Flo and I exchanged glances. Not to be shallow, but dating an invisible man was bound to be complicated. I waited until Natalie was out of earshot.</p>
<p class="follow">"What's going on with Slim?"</p>
<p class="follow">"He's doing some undercover work for the council. It must be going well, because he's in a better mood than I've seen him all month."</p>

<p class="follow">"Deep undercover, obviously." I giggled.</p>
<p class="follow">"Something about the doppelgangers," Flo said quietly, after a quick glance at Mrs. Mason, who seemed absorbed in her breakfast. "That's all I know. He's being secretive." She slammed the cash register drawer shut.</p>
<p class="follow">I paused. "I think someone may be on to him," I whispered. Then I told her about discovering Deputy Doppelganger in the diner earlier that morning.</p>
<p class="follow">"Maybe he just wanted some pie," Flo replied, eying the empty dessert display case.</p>
<p class="follow">"Maybe," I said. "But things looked out of place in the office and there were candy wrappers all over Slim's desk."</p>
<p class="follow">She frowned. "It's probably nothing," she finally said, "but you should mention it to Slim, just in case. But not in front of Natalie."</p>
<p class="follow">"Okay. I'd better get back there." I grabbed a couple of mugs and filled them with coffee before hurrying back to the kitchen.</p>
<p class="follow">I handed Slim his cup, then remembered. "I forgot your cream."</p>
<p class="follow">"Don't worry about it, Daisy. There's milk in the walk-in."</p>
<p class="follow">I remembered Flo's advice and gave Slim a quick rundown of what I'd observed that morning. I was too busy to dwell on Slim's extracurricular activities any longer, but I did notice that throughout the morning, nothing got to him. Not when I overcooked Mr. Bone's steak and scrambled instead of fried his eggs, not when Flo broke a half-dozen plates, and not even when the dishwasher called in sick. Slim just kept whistling.</p>
<p class="follow">It was kind of annoying, actually, especially when Natalie kept shooting him lovesick looks when she thought no one was watching.</p>
<p class="follow">After my shift was over, I found a message on my cell from Rose, telling me to hurry home.</p>
<p class="follow">When I walked into the living room, Grandma Giordano was there. My grandma was tall and thin, with deep-set brown eyes. Her hair was a gorgeous shade of silver and she wore a pair of trousers, which fit her perfectly, and a cream silk blouse. I'd never seen my grandma in a pair of shorts, even on the hottest day.</p>
<p class="follow">Her gaze focused on the door behind me.</p>
<p class="follow">"Where is he?" My sisters and I exchanged glances.</p>
<p class="follow">"He's..." I hesitated.</p>
<p class="follow">"Did you think my own son wouldn't call me? I've already heard the news. It's all over town. Where is he?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Grandma," Poppy said, "we're not sure it's Dad."</p>
<p class="follow">"Of course it is. Do you think I wouldn't remember my own son?"</p>
<p class="follow">Our cautious, rational grandmother had completely lost it. I took a deep breath. "You had to have heard about the doppelgangers?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Yes, but what does that have to do with your father?" I recognized that stubborn look. It was the same one I'd get on my face occasionally.</p>
<p class="follow">"Maybe nothing, but we want to be sure it was him. Something seemed off when he visited me at Slim's."</p>
<p class="follow">"Off how?" Grandma sounded defensive.</p>
<p class="follow">"Why hasn't he contacted Mom?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Your mother is in Italy. He wants to talk to her face-to-face. Wouldn't you?"</p>
<p class="follow">She had a point. My memories of my dad had faded. And I didn't have the heart to extinguish that hopeful light in her eye. Evidently, neither did Poppy or Rose.</p>
<p class="follow">A key turned in the door, and a second later, Dad strode into the room. "Girls, I'm home!" he said cheerily.</p>
<p class="follow">A key chain with <b>world's greatest dad</b> on it dangled from his hand. I gasped. I remembered giving him one just like that for Father's Day when I was nine.</p>
<p class="follow">"Poppy," he said. "You've cut your hair." When my father left, Poppy still had hair down to her waist.</p>
<p class="follow">That stopped her in her tracks, but she recovered swiftly. "That long hair was a pain to take care of, Dad."</p>
<p class="follow">I could see that Poppy's resolve to keep Dad at arm's length until we were sure about his identity was fading fast. "Oh, Daddy, I'm so glad you're back," she cried, and rushed toward him. He embraced her in a rather stiff-looking hug.</p>
<p class="follow">As he hugged my sister, I studied his face carefully. He'd always been handsome, but age had added distinction to his good looks.</p>
<p class="follow">"And Rose," he said when Poppy finally let go of him, "I can't believe how you've grown. You're a woman now."</p>
<p class="follow">Rose shifted uncomfortably and mumbled a hello.</p>
<p class="follow">"Rafe, it's been so long," Grandma said.</p>
<p class="follow">"I know, Mama, and I'm sorry," he said. He embraced her, and I could see tears in Grandma's eyes.</p>
<p class="follow">"We have a lot of catching up to do," Dad said. "Do you mind if we go outside? Confined spaces make me nervous."</p>
<p class="follow">"Of course," Grandma Giordano said. "You poor thing. Locked up all that time." The two of them strode arm in arm out to the backyard.</p>
<p class="follow">I rolled my eyes. You could hardly call our spacious living room "confined."</p>
<p class="follow">After they were out of earshot, Rose said in a low voice, "What are we going to do?"</p>
<p class="follow">"There's nothing we can do, not as long as we don't know for sure who this guy is."</p>
<p class="follow">"What if he is Dad?"</p>
<p class="follow">"It's possible," I said.</p>
<p class="follow">"He had a key, Daisy," Poppy pointed out. "And it worked. He even had the same key chain as Dad. If it's not him, how do you explain that?"</p>
<p class="follow">I shrugged. "I don't know, but the timing is suspect."</p>

<p class="follow">"Not necessarily," Poppy replied. "Maybe there's a reason he hasn't shown up until now. Like, he didn't know what kind of reception he'd get. He has no way of knowing that Mom has been—"</p>
<p class="follow">"Pining for him? True, but I don't think we should say anything to her when she calls."</p>
<p class="follow">"What if he answers the phone?"</p>
<p class="follow">"We'll have to make sure that doesn't happen," Rose said. "Just until we can investigate him."</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy looked appalled. "Investigate our own father?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Investigate the man who <em>might be</em> our father," I said. "He could be a DoppelDad, remember? He said he doesn't recall how he was abducted, but I read his mind and found out that he <em>does</em> have memories of it. Why would he keep that knowledge from us?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Maybe to protect us," Poppy said.</p>
<p class="follow">"We can't just walk up to him and start asking questions," Rose said. "If he's a phony, he's not just going to confess to it."</p>
<p class="follow">"True," I replied. "But it's natural that we'd be curious about where he's been."</p>
<p class="follow">"We need to look for a sign that he's a fake," Rose said.</p>
<p class="follow">"Like what?" Poppy asked.</p>
<p class="follow">"Sugar," I said. "Remember, at the council meeting they said that doppelgangers love sugar."</p>
<p class="follow">"Dad has a sweet tooth," Rose pointed out. "That's going to make it tougher to figure out if this guy's real or not."</p>

<p class="follow">"I don't remember that," I said stubbornly.</p>
<p class="follow">"Well, he used to, anyway," she replied, with a shrug. "People do change, but don't you remember how Mom would always buy him chocolate from that little place on the boardwalk? He loved chocolate, just like you."</p>
<p class="follow">I hadn't remembered, not until now. What else had I forgotten in the years since I'd seen my father?</p>
<p class="follow">"We should concentrate on finding out more about him," I said. "Grandma's keeping him occupied for now, but I'll try to keep an eye on him and see if he lets anything slip."</p>
<p class="follow">"You're the youngest. Why do you get Dad?" Poppy asked.</p>
<p class="follow">"Because I'm the one he approached. That means he thinks I'm the weakest link."</p>
<p class="follow">"Or maybe it really is Dad and he just missed you."</p>
<p class="follow">"We can't think that way, not yet." <em>Not even as much as l want to think that way.</em> "Not until we have proof that he could be our father."</p>
<p class="follow">Just then there was a knock on the door. I looked at my watch. "Oh no," I said. "It's probably Ryan. We have a date tonight."</p>
<p class="follow">"Obviously, you can't go now," Poppy said, nodding in the direction of Dad.</p>
<p class="follow">"Tell him you're sick," Rose said.</p>
<p class="follow">"I don't like lying to my boyfriend," I protested.</p>
<p class="follow">"It's a white lie," Rose said softly. "If Ryan finds out Dad is here, he'll tell his dad, who will tell the whole council, who will come over here and take him away to see if he's a doppelganger. I think we should try to see if we can figure this out on our own first, don't you?"</p>
<p class="follow">I nodded, recalling how upset Deputy Doppelganger had looked in the holding cell this morning. I didn't want my dad—if he was—to be there unless it was absolutely necessary. Finally I answered the door, only opening it a crack.</p>
<p class="follow">"Hey," Ryan said hesitantly when he saw me still wearing my food-splattered apron from work. "Are you okay? Did you forget we have plans tonight?"</p>
<p class="follow">"No, I was going to call you. I'm not feeling too well. I think I'm just going to relax at home tonight."</p>
<p class="follow">"Oh," Ryan said. "Well, do you need some company? Can I come in?"</p>
<p class="follow">"You'd better not," I said. "I wouldn't want you to catch anything. So ... I'll call you when I feel better, okay?"</p>
<p class="follow">Ryan stuck his foot in the door to prevent me from closing it. "Is there something wrong, Daisy?"</p>
<p class="follow">My face flushed bright red. I was a terrible liar. "No, I told you, I'm just sick."</p>
<p class="follow">Ryan's eyes narrowed. "This wouldn't happen to have anything to do with your dad, would it? My dad told me that he—or his doppelganger—was spotted in town today. He's not <em>here,</em> is he?"</p>
<p class="follow">I glanced back at the couch, where Poppy and Rose were shaking their heads and mouthing <em>no, no, no.</em></p><p class="follow">"No, of course not," I said to Ryan.</p>
<p class="follow">I was glad that Dad was still out in the backyard with Grandma, where Ryan couldn't hear or see him.</p>
<p class="follow">"Well ... okay," Ryan said reluctantly. "You will call me or my dad if you see the guy, right?"</p>
<p class="follow">I nodded, and faked a few coughs for good measure.</p>
<p class="follow">"Get some rest," he said, then leaned over to kiss my forehead.</p>
<p class="follow">When I shut the door, Poppy cried, "That was close!"</p>
<p class="follow">I hated lying to Ryan. "Now I really do feel sick."</p>
