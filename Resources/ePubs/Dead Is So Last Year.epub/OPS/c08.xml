<h1 class="chaptertitle">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<p class="left"><b><em>I called Ryan's house</em></b> the next morning during my break at Slim's, but I got his answering machine. I tried his cell, too, but there was no answer. By the time I left work, he still hadn't returned my call. I tried not to get irritated. It was late in the afternoon when he finally called me back. Rose and Poppy were both still at work, so I jumped a little when the phone rang.</p>
<p class="follow">He sounded stressed.</p>
<p class="follow">"I'm in Orange County," he said.</p>
<p class="follow">"What?" I was startled. He hadn't mentioned any upcoming trips, but I did know that he had family there.</p>
<p class="follow">"My grandmother took a fall yesterday. Dad and I left Nightshade last night right before dinner."</p>
<p class="follow">I knew it hadn't been Ryan in the pack last night, but I was relieved to hear that he'd already been on the road when we saw the teen wolves.</p>
<p class="follow">"Is she okay?"</p>
<p class="follow">"She broke her hip and she's a little shaken up. The surgery went well, but Dad and I will be here at least a week or two."</p>

<p class="follow">"Is there anything I can do?" There was no way I was going to tell him about the teen werewolf pack, not now. He had enough on his mind.</p>
<p class="follow">"Just be careful, Daisy. And ask Nicholas for help if you need it."</p>
<p class="follow">"Nicholas? I can take care of myself."</p>
<p class="follow">"I know you can," he said gently. "But a little backup wouldn't hurt."</p>
<p class="follow">After I hung up with Ryan, I weighed my options. I couldn't prove for certain that Wolfie was the culprit, but talking to Nicholas might be good. If nothing else, he could give me a little insight about pack behavior.</p>
<p class="follow">I wandered into the kitchen and took down a mixing bowl. I always thought more clearly when I was cooking. I'd start with the dessert. I decided on fresh peach ice cream. Poppy loved ice cream of any kind and ice cream might tempt her appetite. She still wasn't eating enough.</p>
<p class="follow">I figured Rose and Poppy would be home from work soon, and sure enough, Rose walked in while I was getting out the ice cream maker.</p>
<p class="follow">"Rose, do you know the next time Nicholas is coming over?"</p>
<p class="follow">"We have a date tonight," she said.</p>
<p class="follow">Perfect timing. "Do you mind if I borrow him for a few minutes? I have some questions about pack behavior."</p>
<p class="follow">"Go right ahead," she said. "Is Ryan having problems or something?"</p>

<p class="follow">"No, it's not that." I told her about Wolfgang Paxton's obnoxious behavior and how Poppy and I had been cornered by the Were pack the night before.</p>
<p class="follow">"Daisy, this is serious," she said. "Remember, Nicholas didn't grow up in a pack, but he's done a lot of research. It sounds like there's a renegade pack on the loose in Nightshade."</p>
<p class="follow">"Why don't you invite Nicholas over for dinner?" I said. "I'll cook and then we can pick his brain."</p>
<p class="follow">"That's a great idea," Rose said. "We were just going to go to a movie or something, but he loves your cooking."</p>
<p class="follow">I felt a warm glow at her praise. I wasn't good at that many things, but I was the only one in my family who was good at cooking. Except my father, but he didn't count. Only the people who stayed with the family counted.</p>
<p class="follow">Rose went upstairs to prepare for her date and then Poppy came in as I was pouring the ice cream mixture into the maker.</p>
<p class="follow">"What's that?" she asked.</p>
<p class="follow">"Fresh peach ice cream," I replied. Her face lit up and I was glad I'd thought of it.</p>
<p class="follow">"Do you need any help?" she asked. "Otherwise, I'm going to go change." She was still in her work clothes.</p>
<p class="follow">"No, thanks," I replied. "I've got it handled."</p>
<p class="follow">Before she went to her room, she reminded me to practice.</p>
<p class="follow">I decided to try to get the pan I used for boiling pasta onto the stove using telekinesis. It worked out okay, except that I spilled a little water on the way over to the stove.</p>

<p class="follow">Since company was coming, I decided to jazz up what I'd planned for dinner. We had the ingredients to make a fresh tomato and herb bruschetta, so I got everything together and put it in the oven for an appetizer.</p>
<p class="follow">I wondered if I might like to be a professional chef someday. My senior year was coming up and I needed to start thinking seriously about my future. But first I had to figure out what was happening in Nightshade.</p>
<p class="follow">When the doorbell rang, I beat Rose to it.</p>
<p class="follow">"Hi, Nicholas," I said.</p>
<p class="follow">"Hi, Daisy." Nicholas smiled politely but looked behind me for Rose. Despite their rocky high school romance, he was clearly totally into my sister. Which was another reason I trusted Nicholas's judgment.</p>
<p class="follow">A timer rang in the kitchen, and I rushed to rescue the bruschetta from the oven. Rose and Nicholas followed me, and Poppy, attracted by the smell of baking bread, appeared a minute later. I transferred the appetizers onto a serving platter and then offered everyone some.</p>
<p class="follow">"These look great," Nicholas said. "Thanks so much for the dinner invite." He grabbed a piece of bruschetta and popped it into his mouth.</p>
<p class="follow">"I heard the phone ring earlier," I said to Poppy." Was that Mom calling about her flight?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Yeah, she called," Poppy replied. "She's not coming home anytime soon. Her case is taking longer than expected."</p>

<p class="follow">I wondered what Mom was up to in Italy. She wasn't telling us the whole story, but there wasn't much I could do about it from Nightshade.</p>
<p class="follow">I changed the subject. "I made pasta, too. It's a new recipe. It should be ready in a minute." I knew pasta in the middle of summer was a little heavy, but Nicholas ate a lot and never seemed to gain an ounce.</p>
<p class="follow">"Why don't we take our plates and sit outside?" Poppy suggested.</p>
<p class="follow">We all grabbed our food and followed her suggestion. There was a little patio table in the backyard that was perfect for the four of us.</p>
<p class="follow">I couldn't very well grill Nicholas until I'd fed him, so I waited until he had eaten before asking him questions.</p>
<p class="follow">"Did Rose tell you about what happened to Poppy and me?"</p>
<p class="follow">He nodded.</p>
<p class="follow">"Can you tell us a little bit about werewolf packs?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Normally, they're made up of families, related groups."</p>
<p class="follow">"Like the Wilders?" I asked.</p>
<p class="follow">"Exactly, although the Wilders are a little different because they have so many species of Were animals besides wolves in their family tree. There are two kinds of Weres, born and made. I have a suspicion that the Weres in the pack that attacked you were made."</p>
<p class="follow">"What makes you think that?"</p>
<p class="follow">"First of all, since they came after you on a night when there wasn't a full moon, they have to be new Weres who don't yet have the control that more experienced adult Weres do."</p>
<p class="follow">I nodded. "I know adult Weres have enough control that they change only when the moon is full. Plus, they were like puppies. Big feet and awkward, but still dangerous."</p>
<p class="follow">"And you say there were about eight of them? There aren't that many Were teenagers in Nightshade."</p>
<p class="follow">"Good point," I replied. "And besides, I don't really see Elise or Bane doing something like that, and I know it wasn't Ryan. He wasn't even in town."</p>
<p class="follow">"How are werewolves made?" Rose asked.</p>
<p class="follow">"It's a risky business," Nicholas said. "A werewolf finds a victim—sometimes willing, sometimes not—and bites him or her. Then the victim has to survive the change."</p>
<p class="follow">"Why would a Were want to do that to someone?" Poppy exclaimed. She sounded repulsed.</p>
<p class="follow">"Power," Nicholas said. "Or loneliness."</p>
<p class="follow">"It wouldn't surprise me if Wolfgang Paxton was involved," I said. "I've seen him be really nasty."</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy nodded. "Me, too."</p>
<p class="follow">Nicholas shook his head. "I would hope Wolfgang would know better than to do such a thing. Nevertheless, I'll tell the council members to keep an eye on him." He paused for another bite of pasta before he asked me, "Would you recognize the pack if you saw them again?" "Definitely the wolf who seemed to be the leader." A troubling thought occurred to me. "Can a werewolf's bite be reversed? I asked.</p>
<p class="follow">Nicholas looked startled. "I don't know.</p>
<p class="follow">"Because I have this weird feeling that Nightshade's football team has started howling at the moon.</p>
<p class="follow">Rose stared at me. "That's terrible."</p>
<p class="follow">"I know, I said. "Sean's on the football team and he's been acting really weird lately. And hanging out with Wolfgang Paxton, someone he couldn't stand before.</p>
<p class="follow">"Is there anything else that makes you think the team is involved? Nicholas asked.</p>
<p class="follow">"They're all ordering their meat rare when they come to Slim's," I said. "And some of them have really bulked up."</p>
<p class="follow">"You should try to talk to Sean," Rose said. "Or ask Sam to."</p>
<p class="follow">"Ryan's Sean's best friend. He's already tried talking to him." I told him what had happened at the movie theater.</p>
<p class="follow">"Something's not right, Nicholas stated.</p>
<p class="follow">We had no idea what an understatement that was. Something was definitely wrong in Nightshade, and teen werewolves were only part of the problem.</p>
