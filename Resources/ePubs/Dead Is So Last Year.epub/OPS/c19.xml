<h1 class="chaptertitle">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1>
<p class="left"><b><em>On Saturday night,</em></b> Ryan was at my house, helping me make cookies. Well, he was helping me eat them, anyway.</p>
<p class="follow">"Do you mind if we hang out with Samantha and Sean tonight?" I asked. "I invited them over. I haven't seen much of either of them lately." I was hoping a little quality time together would help Sean and Ryan drop whatever beef they had.</p>
<p class="follow">"Sure, that would be great," Ryan said. But I could tell by his expression that something was bothering him. I gave him an inquiring look.</p>
<p class="follow">"Things haven't been so great between Sean and me lately, ever since he started hanging out with Wolfgang. He barely even talks to me at practice anymore."</p>
<p class="follow">"He's your best friend," I said.</p>
<p class="follow">"He <em>was</em> my best friend," Ryan replied. "But I'm not sure he still is."</p>
<p class="follow">"Of course he is!" I said, truly alarmed now.</p>
<p class="follow">"I hope tonight will help," Ryan said. "He acts like he's mad at me."</p>
<p class="follow">"About what?"</p>
<p class="follow">"That's just it. He won't tell me. Whenever I ask him about it, he just says nothing is wrong."</p>
<p class="follow">"Samantha says he hasn't been acting like himself to her, either. Do you know what's going on with him? He's as moody as you were when you were going through your ... change."</p>
<p class="follow">"But Sean's not a Were," Ryan pointed out reasonably.</p>
<p class="follow">"Not that we know of," I muttered.</p>
<p class="follow">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="follow">"It's just that Nicholas mentioned that werewolves could be made," I said.</p>
<p class="follow">Ryan looked horrified. "Yes, but no one in their right mind would do something like that."</p>
<p class="follow">"Wolfie might," I said. "Maybe Sean's just going along with it."</p>
<p class="follow">"Why?" Ryan sounded skeptical. "That doesn't sound like Sean at all. He's a good guy."</p>
<p class="follow">I shrugged. I didn't know, but I intended to find out.</p>
<p class="follow">About an hour later, Sam and Sean were on my doorstep. I invited them in and gave Sam a big hug. "I feel like I haven't seen you all summer," I said.</p>
<p class="follow">"I know,"she said. "But we've both been busy with our new jobs and the guys have been busy with football."</p>
<p class="follow">"How is football going?" I asked Sean casually.</p>
<p class="follow">"Okay," Sean muttered. I noticed that he didn't make eye contact with Ryan. Something was definitely wrong. I looked at Sam, but she just shrugged.</p>
<p class="follow">I changed the subject." Are you guys hungry? I made cookies."</p>
<p class="follow">Sean looked at his hand. "I already ate."</p>
<p class="follow">Samantha elbowed him sharply. "I mean, thank you, but I've already eaten," Sean said.</p>
<p class="follow">"How about a game of Scrabble?" Ryan suggested.</p>
<p class="follow">I winced. Sean was notoriously bad at spelling, but to my surprise, he brightened. "That's a good idea."</p>
<p class="follow">We sat on the rug in the living room and set up the game. But the evening deteriorated quickly when the first word Sean spelled out was <em>liar.</em> He glared at Ryan as the points were tallied, but Ryan was doing his best to ignore it.</p>
<p class="follow">Sean's next word was either <em>furry</em> or <em>fury,</em> but I didn't have a chance to verify it before Ryan knocked the tiles off the board.</p>
<p class="follow">"What's your problem?" he said to Sean. The tendons in his neck stood out. "You've been acting like an ass all summer."</p>
<p class="follow">"You're the one with the problem," Sean replied. "You wanna take this outside?"</p>
<p class="follow">Ryan nodded. "If that's what you want. Are you going to get your little pal Wolfie to help you?" he said mockingly.</p>
<p class="follow">"At least Wolfie is honest," Sean shot back.</p>
<p class="follow">"Guys," Sam said. "Knock it off. You're friends."</p>
<p class="follow">"That's what I thought," Sean said. "I thought we were best friends, but evidently, we're not. Best friends tell each other everything."</p>
<p class="follow">"What haven't I told you?" Ryan demanded.</p>
<p class="follow">Sean stared at him and got to his feet. "Did it slip your mind that you turn furry and howl at the moon once a month? A little information you might have shared with your <em>best friend.</em>" With that, he turned and left the house.</p>
<p class="follow">There was silence in the room for a minute, then Ryan said, "I can't believe I didn't tell him."</p>
<p class="follow">"Well, someone did," Samantha said. "Wolfgang."</p>
<p class="follow">Frankly, I couldn't believe it, either, but now was not the time to tell my boyfriend that. "Go after him," I urged. "Just explain it."</p>
<p class="follow">"Good idea," Ryan said. "At least I can try."</p>
<p class="follow">After they both were gone, Samantha and I looked at each other for a minute.</p>
<p class="follow">"Boys," she said, after the long silence. "They're so moody." And then shrugged, and grabbed a cookie.</p>
<p class="follow">We spent an hour playing Scrabble, but neither of the guys came back. Finally, Samantha and I called it a night.</p>
<p class="follow">"Do you think they made up?" she said before she left.</p>
<p class="follow">"They had to have," I said. "They're best friends, aren't they?"</p>
<p class="follow">"I don't know," she said. "They were both really angry, and Sean does some stupid things when he's mad."</p>
<p class="follow">It wasn't long before we found out exactly how stupid Sean could be.</p>
