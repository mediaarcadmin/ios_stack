<h1 class="chaptertitle">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<p class="left"><b><em>After a few weeks</em></b> of my working at the diner, Slim finally trusted me in the kitchen alone. At least, I <em>thought</em> he did. When your boss was an invisible man, it was hard to know for sure. I was getting more cooking shifts and fewer serving shifts. Of course, that could be because I drove Flo crazy when I made mistakes.</p>
<p class="follow">"Daisy," Slim said, "can I ask you a favor?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Sure." I faced the general direction of where I thought he was. Today it was fairly easy because he was chopping onions and I saw the knife flash.</p>
<p class="follow">I waited, but he didn't say anything. Finally, he cleared his throat. "Do you think you could handle the morning shift on your own for a while on Saturday?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Really?" I beamed at him. Then a thought struck me. "Is everything all right?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Yes, of course," he said. "But I'd rather you didn't say anything to Natalie. Or anyone else. Natalie gets anxious when I'm away. She'll notice eventually, but I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't call her attention to my absence."</p>
<p class="follow">"Of course," I said. "Does Flo know?"</p>
<p class="follow">I knew Natalie would kill me if she found out I'd been covering for her boyfriend. But he was a grown man, after all.</p>
<p class="follow">I wondered what kind of plans Slim had that he didn't want his girlfriend to know about, but I wasn't going to ask my boss about his love life. "What time should I be here?"</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">When my alarm rang at four <span style="font-size: smaller">A.M.</span>, I rolled over and groaned. I was faced with leaving for work in the pitch-black. The thought that only the vamps and me were up at this hour didn't help. At least until daybreak, that is.</p>
<p class="follow">I took a quick shower and got into some old clothes. They were still decent enough to wear to work, but I wouldn't be devastated if I stained, scorched, or sweated on anything I had on.</p>
<p class="follow">I braided my hair, then grabbed the car keys. Rose would drop off Poppy later in the morning. She'd be chomping at the bit to have the car, because she had to work later that day, but there was no way she was getting up early enough to take me to work. Being a two-car family was a pain sometimes, but it could be worse. We could all be harpies, like the Dickersons.</p>
<p class="follow">Although there was plenty of parking out front, I parked in the alley behind the restaurant. Slim preferred that staff park in the back.</p>

<p class="follow">The lights were already on at the donut shop across the street, and as I got out of the car, I breathed in the intoxicating smell of sugar and fried dough. My stomach growled loudly.</p>
<p class="follow">At least, I was hoping it was my stomach and not one of Nightshade's scarier residents when I noticed movement over by the dumpster.</p>
<p class="follow">A shabby figure stepped out of the shadows. Am an, wearing dark clothes and a hat slung low, his mouth stuffed with yesterday's stale cinnamon rolls. He groaned as he chewed. It took me a minute to recognize the features under the wide-brimmed hat.</p>
<p class="follow">It was my father. The father I hadn't seen in years.</p>
<p class="follow">"Dad?" I said, shocked. The keys jangled as they dropped to the pavement. At the sound of my voice, he bolted away. I was unable to move as the knowledge swirled in my brain. My father was back in Nightshade and had made no attempt to contact his family.</p>
<p class="follow">After a long time, I picked up my keys with shaking hands and let myself into the diner. But I worried all through my shift. My previously elegant, immaculately clad dad had been dressed in a grungy pair of eighties parachute pants and a red flannel shirt. And he looked like he'd spent the last six years in a dumpster.</p>
<p class="follow">The diner was packed for breakfast, and I spent the next few hours sweating cinnamon rolls and black coffee. Gradually, the orders petered out and the restaurant emptied. I wandered to the front to get a coffee.</p>
<p class="follow">"You'd better take a break before the lunch rush starts." Flo patted a stool next to hers.</p>
<p class="follow">I was still consumed with second-guessing myself. Had it really been my father? And if it was, how on earth could I tell Mom?</p>
<p class="follow">Maybe the jukebox could shed a little light on the subject. It wasn't like other jukeboxes, any more than Nightshade was like other towns. The music player had given me plenty of clues solving other cases, but would it help me solve this one?</p>
<p class="follow">I handed Flo a five and asked for change in quarters. "Think Lil is still mad?" I asked, with a nod toward the jukebox.</p>
<p class="follow">She shrugged. "I think she missed you."</p>
<p class="follow">I fed my stack of quarters into the machine and punched in my selections, but there was no reaction. Not even my normal selections played. I was being given the silent treatment.</p>
<p class="follow">"Look, I'm sorry I was gone so long," I whispered. "But I really need your help."</p>
<p class="follow">Nothing. I checked my watch. It was almost eleven. Time to get ready for the lunch rush.</p>
<p class="follow">The door opened and Penny Edwards walked in.</p>
<p class="follow">"Hi, Penny," I said, eyeing her cautiously. Which Penny would I see today? The old Penny or the Penny at the beach?</p>
<p class="follow">"Giordano," she said, "I'm supposed to meet the rest of the cheerleaders here. Can you show me to a table?" Penny seemed to be up to her usual tricks.</p>
<p class="follow">"We don't have a hostess here, Penny," I replied. "Just pick a spot and sit down."</p>
<p class="follow">She made it almost impossible to like her. There were no other customers, so I poured myself a cup of coffee and sat on one of the stools next to Flo. I wasn't going to fall all over myself to wait on Penny.</p>
<p class="follow">A few minutes later, other cheerleaders drifted in.</p>
<p class="follow">"Daisy, it's nice to see you," Rachel said. She gave me a big hug.</p>
<p class="follow">"I'm glad to see you," I said, hugging her back. Samantha and the rest of the squad came in, and since they were the only customers in the restaurant, I stayed and chatted.</p>
<p class="follow">"Could we <em>please</em> get some water? Like sometime today?" Penny demanded in a cold voice. I laid a restraining hand on Flo's arm." I'll get it." I didn't want the whole squad getting kicked out of Slim's because of Penny's snotty attitude. Flo was capable of banishing them for much less.</p>
<p class="follow">I gave everyone glasses and set the water pitcher down in front of Penny. She gave me the cold shoulder, but her eyes held the gleam they got when she had good dirt. By the way she could barely suppress her glee when she looked at me, I knew that she was dying to say something about my sisters or me.</p>
<p class="follow">Flo took their order, which consisted of a dozen diet sodas, several salads, and a couple of orders of fries, so I headed back to the kitchen, but not before I heard Penny's raised voice. What had her in such a dither?</p>
<p class="follow">"He's in town, I'm telling you. My mother saw him in the parking lot of the grocery store and he looked like a bum or something."</p>
<p class="follow">"Shut up, Penny," Sam hissed, but for once, Penny ignored her.</p>
<p class="follow">"I'm telling you, it was Mr. Giordano."</p>
<p class="follow">So my father wasn't a figment of my imagination.</p>
<p class="follow">The jukebox chose that moment to end its silence and "Big Mouth Strikes Again" by the Smiths came on. Lil had finally forgiven me, but now I had bigger problems. If Penny had seen my dad, it was only a matter of time before news of his presence would be all over Nightshade.</p>
