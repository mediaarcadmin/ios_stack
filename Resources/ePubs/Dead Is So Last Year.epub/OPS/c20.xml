<h1 class="chaptertitle">CHAPTER TWENTY</h1>
<p class="left"><b><em>For the big night</em></b> of our "family" dinner with Dad, my sisters and I had decided on barbecued chicken, homemade potato salad, and watermelon, with chocolate cake for dessert. Grandma insisted on giving us money for groceries, so Poppy and I headed to the grocery store to buy the ingredients.</p>
<p class="follow">We were in the meat section when she nudged me. "Isn't that Wolfgang Paxton?" she said in a whisper. "What is he doing? Harassing the butcher?"</p>
<p class="follow">I laughed, but sobered quickly. I wouldn't put it past him.</p>
<p class="follow">He was standing at the meat counter, where the butcher handed him several large items wrapped in white paper. His cart was piled high.</p>
<p class="follow">"Evidently, buying enough raw meat to feed an army," I replied.</p>
<p class="follow">There was quite a line, so Poppy and I patiently waited our turn. Wolfgang was still loading up his cart when I noticed Sean approaching him.</p>

<p class="follow">Poppy noticed, too. "I've never seen Sean look so angry," she said.</p>
<p class="follow">He and Wolfie had engaged in a low-voiced conversation, and it was clear from the expressions on their faces and their body language that they were arguing. I strained to hear, but it was too noisy in the store and they were speaking much too quietly.</p>
<p class="follow">Wolfgang openly smirked at Sean and then gave him a little shove. It took some nerve to get physical with Sean, who was a big guy. Of course, Wolfgang was a werewolf, which gave him an advantage, but my money was still on Sean.</p>
<p class="follow">The guy was completely out of control.</p>
<p class="follow">I was startled when Sean jabbed his finger into Wolfie's chest for emphasis and then strode away. Wolfgang didn't even flinch, but I saw him gazing after Sean with a look of hatred. He looked up and caught me staring. His lip curled back into a nasty smile and I looked away. When I looked up again, he was gone.</p>
<p class="follow">I gave the butcher our order, then Poppy and I went to the next aisle to finish the shopping, but my mind was busy. I looked down and realized that I'd managed to float a couple of bars of chocolate into the cart without even realizing.</p>
<p class="follow">I looked up at Poppy. "Hey, did you pick those up?"</p>
<p class="follow">She giggled. "No, you did. And I think you almost gave Mr. Hanson a heart attack when he saw those chocolates float by."</p>
<p class="follow">"Oops, I'd better pay better attention," I said. I didn't want everyone in Nightshade to know I had telekinetic powers.</p>

<p class="follow">What were Wolfgang and Sean talking about? It had looked like they were arguing. Was Sean somehow involved in the rogue pack?</p>
<p class="follow">I had put the questions out of my mind by the time Poppy and I got home. We were already behind schedule, so I put the chicken in marinade and started the chocolate cake.</p>
<p class="follow">Rose and Poppy decided to hang out in the backyard with me while I cooked the chicken. I didn't have much experience using our barbecue, but I'd learned a lot from Slim, so I had confidence that I wouldn't burn the chicken.</p>
<p class="follow">I managed to get dinner ready in time. Despite the fact that our DoppelDad was a no-show, I was pleased to see that Grandma was enjoying herself. She had been glum ever since he had left the house. I didn't want to think about how she was going to react when she found out that he wasn't her son.</p>
<p class="follow">Grandma said, "Daisy, that was delicious. Thank you."</p>
<p class="follow">Everyone commented on how good the potato salad was and I glowed with pride.</p>
<p class="follow">"Slim gave me the recipe," I admitted. "But he said I can't reveal the secret ingredient."</p>
<p class="follow">Rose laughed. "As long as it's not magical, I don't care. Just keep making it!"</p>
<p class="follow">It was a close, humid night, and although it was getting dark by the time we'd finished our meal, no one felt like going inside yet. Poppy and Rose and I took the dirty plates into the kitchen and then I sliced up the chocolate cake and brought it back outside on a tray.</p>
<p class="follow">"I forgot the pitcher of milk," I said.</p>
<p class="follow">"Sit down," Rose commanded. "I'll get it."</p>
<p class="follow">I took a seat in my favorite Adirondack chair and leaned back contentedly. It felt like we were in for a summer storm, but there was a slight breeze blowing.</p>
<p class="follow">Rose appeared with the pitcher of cold milk. A second later, I heard a growl and a large animal bounded out of the shrubbery and went flying toward her. She screamed but kept a death grip on the pitcher.</p>
<p class="follow">It was a shaggy gray wolf. His fangs were bared and he moved so quickly, I could barely breathe, let alone think. Poppy saved the day. With a quick look, she sent the glass pitcher flying. It hit the wolf squarely on the head and knocked it out. Milk ran down its motionless face.</p>
<p class="follow">We were frozen in shock for a few minutes.</p>
<p class="follow">"Why the sudden interest from the werewolf community?" I wondered aloud when I finally found my voice again.</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy asked, "Is it dead?"</p>
<p class="follow">"I don't think so," Rose said. "Just unconscious."</p>
<p class="follow">"Go get some rope from the garage. And hurry," Grandma said to Poppy.</p>
<p class="follow">"Rose, sit down," I said. "You look like you're going to faint." She did as I told her. Her face was as white as the milk.</p>

<p class="follow">Poppy came back with the rope. The animal hadn't stirred, but I was still surprised when Grandma grabbed the rope.</p>
<p class="follow">"Be careful!" I said.</p>
<p class="follow">"Don't worry," she said. "When I'm done, this wolf won't be able to move. Poppy, call Nicholas and tell him to come over. We have a problem."</p>
<p class="follow">A big hairy problem.</p>
<p class="follow">While Poppy dialed Nicholas, I stared up at the sky. There was no sign of a full moon, which convinced me that this was a young wolf, maybe even one of the pack we'd seen before. But why did they keep coming back to our house?</p>
<p class="follow">"Obviously, someone has it out for the Giordano family." I hadn't realized that I said it aloud, until Poppy gave me a dirty look.</p>
<p class="follow">I clapped a hand over my mouth. We had tried to protect Grandma from as much of Nightshade's weirdness as possible, but by the calm, efficient way she was trussing up the werewolf, our protective behavior might not have been necessary. She evidently wasn't fazed by much, including a visit from someone from the supernatural community.</p>
<p class="follow">Nicholas must have broken a few traffic laws, because we barely had the wolf tied up before he arrived.</p>
<p class="follow">"Rose, are you okay?" he said. She stood up shakily and he took her into his arms.</p>
<p class="follow">"I'm fine. Poppy saved me with a pitcher of milk. Good thing Daisy doesn't like plastic," she joked weakly.</p>

<p class="follow">Nicholas looked over at the werewolf. Grandma had him tied up as neatly as she wrapped our Christmas presents.</p>
<p class="follow">"What should we do with him?" Rose said.</p>
<p class="follow">"I'll take him to the garage," Nicholas said. "I have a feeling that the wolf will be shifting back to its human form soon and then we'll know who is behind this bad behavior."</p>
<p class="follow">Nicholas grabbed the werewolf and lifted it easily. His super strength came in handy.</p>
<p class="follow">It occurred to me that that kind of strength could come in handy for football, and I wondered again if this Were was someone on the team.</p>
<p class="follow">The rest of us trooped to the garage after Nicholas, although I noticed Poppy managed to scoop up a slice of chocolate cake before she exited.</p>
<p class="follow">Nicholas found a couple of old towels and draped them over the creature for modesty's sake. I wasn't sure whose modesty he was trying to protect, ours or the wolf's, but either way, when the creature reregained its human form, now it wouldn't do so naked.</p>
<p class="follow">About an hour later, the transformation began. I thought I'd see Wolfgang Paxton. But I was as surprised as everyone else when I saw who it was.</p>
<p class="follow">"Sean?" I said.</p>
<p class="follow">Wait until Ryan heard about this.</p>
