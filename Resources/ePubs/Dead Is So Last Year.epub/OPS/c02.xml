<h1 class="chaptertitle"><a id='bliopage20'/>CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<p class="left"><b><em>When I got home</em></b> from the diner, I was in a great mood. Poppy, however, was not. She was sitting in the living room, with the shades drawn. Her laptop was on the table beside her, and the screen revealed our vacation pictures, which she'd obviously uploaded from the digital camera.</p>
<p class="follow">"The Trevi Fountain was so beautiful," she said, then sighed. "I wish we were still in Italy."</p>
<p class="follow">"Funny," I said, "because you looked miserable the entire time we were there."</p>
<p class="follow">"Well, it's even harder being back in Nightshade," Poppy said. "Everything reminds me of Gage."</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy's ghost boyfriend had haunted Nightshade just long enough to take Poppy to the prom before he finally left this world forever, breaking her heart in the process.</p>
<p class="follow">"Have you been out of the house at all today?" I asked. I looked toward the window and, after concentrating for a moment, used my telekinesis to pull open the curtains and let in some sunshine. "It's a beautiful day."</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage21'/>"Of course I've been out," Poppy said indignantly.</p>
<p class="follow">"Going to the graveyard doesn't count."</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy crossed her arms and gave me a pouty look. My social-butterfly sister hadn't been the same since her heart was broken.</p>
<p class="follow">"Gage is gone, Poppy," I said gently. "He wouldn't want you to—"</p>
<p class="follow">"How do you know what he wanted?" she snapped, then looked contrite. "I'm sorry, Daisy, I know you're trying to help. It's just that I miss him so much." Tears filled her eyes.</p>
<p class="follow">It killed me to see my sister so sad, but Poppy had been moping far too long. Her hair looked like it hadn't been washed in days, and her skin was pale. Her jeans were starting to hang on her and I wondered how she'd lost weight when we ate all that pasta in Italy. Actually, come to think of it, I ate the pasta; Poppy just picked at it.</p>
<p class="follow">I sat next to Poppy and put an arm around her delicate shoulders. "We've got a whole summer of fun ahead of us," I said. "We have the house to ourselves..."</p>
<p class="follow">"What else is new?" Poppy said. "Mom's usually always working when she is around, and Dad..."</p>
<p class="follow">"I know," I said. Our father had disappeared during a research trip, when I was twelve. Almost six years had passed and we still had no idea what had happened to him.</p>
<p class="follow">But a few months back, I had gotten a lead: It seemed he might be being held against his will by the Scourge, a covert group whose goal was to wipe out the paranormal population.</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage22'/>But my father was a norm, so what could they want with him? And if they did have him, where were they keeping him? These were all things I planned to find out this summer, and I had a feeling my mom did, too.</p>
<p class="follow">Finding my father was practically all she had thought about since he'd been gone. Even when there were whispers that Rafe Giordano had just abandoned his family, Mom had never lost hope that he was alive and well and eager to get back to us. I hoped she was right.</p>
<p class="follow">I snapped out of my momentary melancholy and got back to cheering up Poppy. "I have an idea," I said. "We should have a party!"</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy gave me a horrified look. "Are you kidding?" she said. "Mom would kill us if we had a party while she's away. And she'd find out about it somehow. You know how people in Nightshade talk."</p>
<p class="follow">There was a jangling of keys and the front door opened to admit our older sister, Rose, still clothed in the lab coat she wore to work. "Not to mention the fact that mom is psychic, geniuses," she said.</p>
<p class="follow">She must have overheard our conversation. Or, she could have just read our minds. Rose didn't like to eavesdrop on other people's thoughts for no reason, but her telepathy was really strong, so it sometimes happened by accident.</p>
<p class="follow">"I don't mean having a party here at the house," I said. "Let's have it at the beach."</p>
 
<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage23'/>The beach wasn't too far from our house, and it was Poppy's favorite place to hang out in the summertime. If that didn't get a reaction, nothing would.</p>
<p class="follow">"The beach?" She brightened for a minute, then deflated. "I don't have a bathing suit to wear."</p>
<p class="follow">"But you have tons of suits," Rose said. "Plus all my hand-me-downs."</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy's expression grew gloomier. "I'm tired of them all."</p>
<p class="follow"><em>Do something,</em> Rose's voice said in my mind. <em>I blew it. Okay, okay, I thought back. We've got to convince her to have this party. What are her favorite things?</em></p>
<p class="follow"><em>Talking on the phone,</em> Rose replied. <em>And shopping</em></p>
<p class="follow"><em>That's it!</em></p>
<p class="follow">I glanced quickly at Poppy, but she didn't seem to notice that Rose and I were communicating nonverbally.</p>
<p class="follow">"We'll take you shopping for a new suit," I said rashly. Shopping wasn't my favorite pastime, but Poppy had always come through for me in a wardrobe emergency.</p>
<p class="follow">"Can we have a bonfire?" she asked.</p>
<p class="follow">"Does that mean you'll show?"</p>
<p class="follow">"I promise," she replied. "It will be good to spend some quality time with a bunch of our friends before everybody starts leaving for college." Like Rose, Poppy would be going to UC Nightshade, so she'd be staying in town.</p>
<p class="follow">"Then a bonfire and a picnic," I said. "And all our friends <a id='bliopage24'/>will be there. It'll be fun." They'd be there if I had to drag every single one of them to the beach.</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy got up and hunted for the cordless phone, which used to be permanently attached to her ear. "I'll call Candy. How about Saturday? That's enough time to plan an amazing party." In a moment, Poppy had wandered into the kitchen and was happily chattering away on the phone to her best friend.</p>
<p class="follow">"A beach party is a good idea," Rose said. "I hope it gets her out of her funk."</p>
<p class="follow">"So do I," I said. "How was your day?"</p>
<p class="follow">Rose looked exhausted. "Long," she said, "but so interesting. I think I'm going to learn a lot from Dr. Franken this summer. She's a brilliant scientist. And she was friends with dad, you know."</p>
<p class="follow">I stiffened. "No, I didn't know that," I said. "What's her area of study?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Genetics," Rose said.</p>
<p class="follow">"You mean like DNA and cloning and stuff?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Well, she's not cloning anyone," Rose said. "That's a pretty sensitive issue. She was telling me that she and Dad had been collaborating before he—"</p>
<p class="follow">Rose was cut off when Poppy bounded back into the living room. "Mom's on the phone," she announced, then put the phone on speaker mode.</p>
<p class="follow">"Hi, Mom," we said in unison.</p>
<p class="follow">"Hi, girls," she said.</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage25'/>"How's Italy?" Rose asked.</p>
<p class="follow">"About the same as when you left here yesterday," Mom said. She chuckled as she said it. Her case must be going well.</p>
<p class="follow">I was glad she sounded happy. I was afraid she'd be lonely over there all by herself. But she was more worried about us, all alone in the house, even though we were old enough to take care of ourselves. After all, Rose was in college, Poppy had just graduated high school, and I'd be a senior at Nightshade High in the fall.</p>
<p class="follow">Before hanging up, she asked if one of us could mail a certain notebook to her. She needed it to compare some old notes to the case she was working on now.</p>
<p class="follow">"Ooh, the post office will be closed by the time I get out of the lab," Rose said.</p>
<p class="follow">"I'll take care of it," I said quickly. I wanted to prove to Mom how responsible we were.</p>
<p class="follow">"Thanks, Daisy," she said. "I knew I could count on you. Now, be careful, girls. Don't let any strangers in the house. I love you."</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy nearly jumped out of her skin when the doorbell rang right after we hung up with Mom. "Who could that be?"</p>
<p class="follow">Rose laughed. "It's probably just Nicholas." Nicholas Bone was Rose's boyfriend.</p>
<p class="follow">"Or Ryan," I said. "He's coming over to watch movies."</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy rolled her eyes as she went to answer the door. "You two and your werewolf boyfriends."</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage26'/>It turned out to be Nicholas. I could understand what Rose saw in him. He was handsome: tall, with pale skin, reddish-brown hair, and brandy-colored eyes. His hair was the exact shade of our Irish setter, Sparky, who died of old age last year. Nicholas also was, as Poppy had mentioned, a werewolf.</p>
<p class="follow">"Hi, Poppy," Nicholas said. "How are things going? Feeling any better?" Nicholas knew all about Poppy's unusual breakup; she had met Gage the ghost at Mort's Mortuary, which was the funeral home owned by Nicholas's father.</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy shrugged and stepped aside for Rose, who was rushing toward the door, obviously thrilled to be reunited with her boyfriend. Nicholas's eyes sparkled when he saw her. It didn't seem to matter to him that she was still in her lab coat looking slightly disheveled. He still loved her.</p>
<p class="follow">As Poppy and I snuck upstairs to give them some privacy, I couldn't help but wonder if Ryan loved me like that.</p>
<p class="follow">I didn't know why I was stressing, except that Ryan was only getting better looking as time passed, and he was no slouch to begin with. It made me conscious that I was still plain old Daisy, okay-looking but certainly nothing special. I didn't have Elise Wilder's dangerous beauty or even the softer glamour of the rest of my own family.</p>
<p class="follow">"Want me to do your makeup?" Poppy asked. <b>"I</b> may not have a date tonight, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't look stunning for yours."</p>
<p class="follow">I nodded, then followed Poppy into the bathroom, where <a id='bliopage27'/>she rummaged around in her makeup bag until she found just the right shade of eye shadow. "This will make your eyes really pop," she said as she applied it. When Poppy was done working her magic, I had to admit I looked pretty great. I blinked at my reflection in the mirror. My blue eyes really stood out.</p>
<p class="follow">"I don't even look like myself," I said, fluttering my mascaraed lashes. "Now I look like someone people <em>expect</em> to see with Ryan."</p>
<p class="follow">"What are you talking about?" Poppy scoffed. "Daisy, you're beautiful even without makeup. And Ryan's crazy about you. You know that, right?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Right."</p>
<p class="follow">"So why would you say something like that?"</p>
<p class="follow">I shrugged. "You should see him, Poppy," I said. "He's even more gorgeous than when we left."</p>
<p class="follow">"So?"</p>
<p class="follow">"So, I'm just ordinary Daisy Giordano."</p>
<p class="follow">"Who he completely adores," Poppy responded. "And you are far from ordinary."</p>
<p class="follow">My head knew that my sister was right. Ryan could have dated any girl in school and he chose me. Now, if I could only start to believe the "far from ordinary" part. It wasn't easy having a boyfriend who put the <em>super</em> in <em>supernatural.</em></p>
