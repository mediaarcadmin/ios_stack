<h1 class="chaptertitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h1>
<p class="left"><b><em>"Sean?" I said again.</em></b> I was having trouble processing the information.</p>
<p class="follow">We untied him and he sat up and put a hand to his head, wincing. I caught him looking down, and noted the relief on his face when he realized he was covered by a blanket.</p>
<p class="follow">"Where am I?" he said.</p>
<p class="follow">"At our house," Poppy said.</p>
<p class="follow">He looked blank.</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy continued, "But the real question is, why are you here?"</p>
<p class="follow">Nicholas grabbed his cell phone and started to dial. "I have to call my father. The council needs to know there's a new werewolf in town."</p>
<p class="follow">"The council?" Sean paled. "What will they do to me? I wasn't trying to hurt anyone ... I just smelled the meat on the barbecue and lost control."</p>
<p class="follow">"Then why did you try to attack Rose?" Nicholas replied. "The council frowns on that kind of behavior."</p>
<p class="follow">Rose put her hand on Nicholas's arm. "Let's hear what he has to say first."</p>
<p class="follow">Nicholas said, "Okay, start talking."</p>
<p class="follow">Sean still looked shaken, but he'd lost some of his bravado.</p>
<p class="follow">He pulled himself together.</p>
<p class="follow">"I think it was the experiments."</p>
<p class="follow">"What kind of experiments?" Poppy asked. He kept mute.</p>
<p class="follow">"Sean, it's important that you tell us the truth. We might be able to help you."</p>
<p class="follow">He wouldn't meet my eyes, but at least he started talking. "Experimenting with 'roids."</p>
<p class="follow">"Steroids?" Rose shot me a horrified look.</p>
<p class="follow">Sean nodded gravely.</p>
<p class="follow">"Are you a complete idiot?" Poppy blurted. "That stuff is dangerous."</p>
<p class="follow">He coughed and a little ball of hair, probably from the pelt of a rabbit, came out of his mouth and landed on the floor. He stared at it, appalled at his social gaffe.</p>
<p class="follow">"I'll get you a glass of water, and some ice for your head," Grandma said as she left the garage.</p>
<p class="follow">She hurried back a few minutes later with an ice pack and a drink for our guest. As she handed it to him, she asked quickly, "Did I miss anything?"</p>
<p class="follow">I shook my head. Sean had been mute, staring at the rabbit fur on the floor the whole time she was gone.</p>
<p class="follow">Now he emptied the glass in one gulp, then sighed. "Thank you. At first I just used regular steroids. But it wasn't working. I wasn't big enough to..."</p>
<p class="follow">"Compete with the Weres on the football team," I guessed. "Go on," I prompted him.</p>
<p class="follow">"But pretty soon, it wasn't just traditional steroids," he continued. "It was something much worse."</p>
<p class="follow">"Worse? How much worse?" Poppy said.</p>
<p class="follow">"I started using what he called a hairball. A hairball is a mixture of traditional steroids and..."</p>
<p class="follow">"And what?" Nicholas prompted him again.</p>
<p class="follow">"Were blood," Sean replied. He hung his head.</p>
<p class="follow">Rose gasped. "That's terrible. Why did you do it?"</p>
<p class="follow">"I just wanted to see what it was like. If my best friend could be a werewolf, why couldn't I? But pretty soon I was shifting almost every night, not just when the moon was full."</p>
<p class="follow">"Where'd you get the hairballs?" I asked.</p>
<p class="follow">Sean shook his head. "I can't say."</p>
<p class="follow">But I'd already guessed. "Wolfie has been a very naughty boy," I said.</p>
<p class="follow">Nicholas picked up his phone. "Definitely council business," he said. "I'll call Dad. He needs to know about this."</p>
<p class="follow">"Excuse us for a moment," Poppy said to Sean. He simply nodded and repositioned the ice pack that was against his head. The rest of us followed her to a spot in the garage, out of his earshot.</p>
<p class="follow">"What are they going to do with Wolfgang?" I asked Rose.</p>

<p class="follow">"I don't care. You heard what he said. That creep is injecting people to turn them into werewolves. Sean's just a victim." Sean was our next-door neighbor, so she had watched him grow up.I knew she had a soft spot for him. But the truth is, he wasn't just a victim. He'd made the decision to go along with Wolfgang, and the damage might be permanent.</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy groaned. "I just can't believe Sean would do steroids. Or hairballs. Whatever."</p>
<p class="follow">Nicholas finished his conversation with his father and hung up. "Dad and Chief Mendez are going to the Paxtons' in a few minutes. I'll take Sean there to meet them."</p>
<p class="follow">"I've got to tell Samantha," I said.</p>
<p class="follow">"What can we do to help?" Rose asked.</p>
<p class="follow">"Hope that the council is able to find a cure for this. I don't think Sean knew what he was getting into. But I do know there's a whole pack of teen werewolves running around, and after what we learned tonight, I'm pretty sure they are on the football team."</p>
<p class="follow">"Let's go inside before any more surprise visitors show up," Grandma said. "And I'll get that poor boy some of your father's clothes."</p>
<p class="follow">She left the garage as I pondered the fact that Mom still had some of Dad's stuff. We'd helped her bag up a bunch of it to donate it. I had thought that that meant she was resolved he wasn't coming back. But maybe she had just done it to appease us. I wondered where his clothes had ended up. A glimmer of a memory teased the edge of my mind, but I couldn't grasp it. I'd seen piles of clothing lately, and it wasn't just in Poppy's room. The memory eluded me.</p>
<p class="follow">Nicholas extended a hand and helped Sean to his feet, none too gently. He grabbed the blanket as it started to slip, then blushed profusely.</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy and I made a quick exit from the garage before we embarrassed the guy any further.</p>
<p class="follow">We congregated in the living room to wait for Grandma to come back with something for Sean to wear. He made sure he had a firm grip on the blanket when he joined us.</p>
<p class="follow">She returned just as the silence was moving from uncomfortable to completely awkward. Handing Sean a stack of men's clothing, she said, "Nicholas, please show our guest where he can change," which meant Nicholas should guard the bathroom door while Sean got dressed. Although Sean's story made a horrible kind of sense, it was not completely clear that the attack was unintentional.</p>
<p class="follow">Wolfgang Paxton was a bad combination of arrogance and inexperience. I could picture him creating new werewolves just for the malicious pleasure of it. But I couldn't figure out why a decent guy like Sean would go along with it.</p>
<p class="follow">Were they that desperate to win a championship?</p>
<p class="follow">I wanted privacy to give Ryan the heads-up on Sean's involvement.</p>
<p class="follow">When I called him and told him the story, as briefly as possible, Ryan sounded grim. "The football team? Are you sure?"</p> 
<p class="follow">"Not certain about all, but at least some of them. Probably freshman string," I said, guessing that those boys would be the most easily influenced by Wolfgang.</p>
<p class="follow">"And..." I hesitated. It was going to be hard for Ryan to hear that Sean was involved, but Ryan knew he had been hanging around Wolfie a lot.</p>
<p class="follow">"And Sean," Ryan finished for me. "I'll be right over."</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">When I answered the door a little later, I was expecting only Ryan, but next to him stood a very irritated Samantha Devereaux. "Er, hi, everyone. Come on in."</p>
<p class="follow">I held the door open and they followed me to the living room.</p>
<p class="follow">Sean sat on the loveseat. There was room next to him, but Sam very pointedly chose a seat far away from her boyfriend.</p>
<p class="follow">Ryan sat next to me on the ottoman. "Did I miss anything?"</p>
<p class="follow">Sean sat in silence, but Samantha glared at him.</p>
<p class="follow">He was in for it now. Samantha was fuming, I could tell.</p>
<p class="follow">Sean cleared his throat. Sam gave him a look and he started talking. "I've been hanging around Wolfgang."</p>
<p class="follow">"Everyone knows that," Sam said impatiently. "Get to the point."</p>
<p class="follow">Pretty soon, the whole sorry story came out.</p>
<p class="follow">"He said the hairballs would improve my game," Sean said. "I told myself I would only try it once, but then I saw a difference—I got stronger and faster, quick. I knew it was wrong. Good thing I stopped. Some of the guys are having ... problems. Worse than me, if you can believe it."</p>
<p class="follow">"Sean!" Sam snapped. "I can't believe you were dumb enough to fall for that."</p>
<p class="follow">He hung his head in shame and mumbled some apologies.</p>
<p class="follow">"I'm going to kill him," Samantha said.</p>
<p class="follow">"Killing a werewolf isn't easy," I joked weakly. "You'd better stock up on silver bullets."</p>
<p class="follow">She flinched.</p>
<p class="follow">"I'm sorry," I said. "That was insensitive."</p>
<p class="follow">"Thanks, Daisy," Sam said. "But even if Sean only did it <em>once,</em> that's bad enough."</p>
<p class="follow">"I didn't let Wolfgang inject me anymore," Sean said, "at least not after I saw what it did to me."</p>
<p class="follow">"What did it do?" Poppy said.</p>
<p class="follow">"At first, it seemed like some kind of miracle," Sean admitted. "These skinny little freshmen bulked up almost overnight. Pretty soon they were lifting the same amount as me." He sounded aggrieved. "I was tempted to keep on using it, believe me. But then we started seeing the side effects."</p>
<p class="follow">"What side effects?" Poppy said.</p>
<p class="follow">"At first, it was just hair. Lots of hair," Sean said. "But then they started to change, and not just once in a while." He turned to Nicholas and asked with a pleading note in his voice, "Is it reversible?"</p>

<p class="follow">Nicholas said, "Possibly." He looked at Ryan. "There's a doctor in town who specializes in Were issues." He was talking about the doctor Rose had taken him to last spring when Ryan had abruptly changed and challenged Nicholas. In the heat of the moment, Nicholas had been injured.</p>
<p class="follow">Sean shuddered. "I hope they can reverse it. After we started changing, some of the guys wanted to stop. But Wolfgang convinced us that this was the only way we were going to take the championship." He looked at Ryan when he said it.</p>
<p class="follow">Ryan shuddered. "I don't want to win like this," he said. "But why did he pick you? Why didn't you tell me?"</p>
<p class="follow">Ryan took my hand as we all listened to the rest of Sean's story.</p>
<p class="follow">"I was ... upset that you hadn't told me you were a werewolf," Sean admitted to Ryan. "Wolfie told me what was going on with you. I thought I might learn something about werewolves by hanging around with him and his crew. I thought it might help me understand what you were going through. But I got in way over my head."</p>
<p class="follow">"I'm sorry, Sean," Ryan said. "I meant to tell you, but—"</p>
<p class="follow">"It's all good," Sean said quickly. "Friends again?" He extended his hand and Ryan shook it vigorously.</p>
<p class="follow">"Friends."</p>
<p class="follow">The impromptu meeting finally broke up.</p>
<p class="follow">Nicholas got to his feet." I've got to go. I have to make a stop at the Paxton residence. There's a certain wolf cub who needs schooling. And we have to see what we can do for this idiot." He grabbed Sean by the collar and steered him toward the door.</p>
<p class="follow">Samantha followed them out. Through our open windows, I could hear her scolding Sean as they walked to Nicholas's car. He wasn't getting off easy on this one.</p>
<p class="follow">I kissed Ryan goodbye. After the house emptied out, I headed for bed, but I couldn't sleep. I wondered if the guys on the team would be okay or if the injections would have permanent side effects. I hoped that Wolfgang Paxton was thoroughly ashamed of himself. If he wasn't now, he would be by the time the Nightshade City Council was through with him.</p>
