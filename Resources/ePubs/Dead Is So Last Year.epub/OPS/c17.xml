<h1 class="chaptertitle">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1>
<p class="left"><b><em>The next day,</em></b> Rose was still bummed out about losing her job, so Poppy convinced her that a little retail therapy would make her feel better. We were driving to the mall when we saw the smoke coming from the direction of Mrs. Mason's.</p>
<p class="follow">"Call 9-1-1," Rose said calmly.</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy had her cell phone at the ready, as usual, and punched in the number.</p>
<p class="follow">Rose pulled the car over and parked far away from the flames, which seemed to be coming from the greenhouse in the back. As we got out of the car, a soot-covered figure dashed from the rear of the house.</p>
<p class="follow">He approached us, out of breath. "Call the fire department," he wheezed. I'd know that voice anywhere. It was Slim.</p>
<p class="follow">"Already done."</p>
<p class="follow">He was covered in soot, so I could almost make out what he'd look like if he weren't invisible. He was tall and thin, with sharp cheekbones and a narrow jaw. I was thankful to see that he was clothed in baggy trousers and a shirt. He smelled like burnt sugar.</p>
<p class="follow">"What happened?" I cried. "Where's Natalie and her grandmother?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Natalie's not home," he said, panting.</p>
<p class="follow">"Mrs. Mason!" Poppy cried. "We've got to try to save her."</p>
<p class="follow">"It's too late," Slim said. He took a long gulp of air. "She was already dead when I found her."</p>
<p class="follow">I gasped. "Was it arson?"</p>
<p class="follow">He shook his head. "Accident. There was an explosion."</p>
<p class="follow">I wanted to ask for more details, but the Nightshade Volunteer Fire Department arrived and set to work. One of the firefighters said it was too late for the greenhouse, but they'd try to save the main house.</p>
<p class="follow">The fire crept closer, so we retreated to a safer distance, where we were standing when Chief Mendez arrived. To my surprise, Mr. Bone was with him.</p>
<p class="follow">"What happened?" Mr. Bone said to Slim.</p>
<p class="follow">Slim didn't say anything, but his glance at us spoke volumes.</p>
<p class="follow">"Does this have anything to do with the doppelgangers?" I asked Slim. "Flo told me you were doing undercover work."</p>
<p class="follow">"Way to blow my cover, sis," he said sarcastically.</p>
<p class="follow">Mr. Bone chuckled. "The Giordanos already know most of the council's business. And what they don't already know, they do a pretty good job guessing."</p>
<p class="follow">Slim nodded. He cleared his throat. "The council's suspicions were correct. Mrs. Mason was making the doppelgangers, using witchcraft."</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy looked incredulous. "One little old lady caused all this madness?"</p>
<p class="follow">Chief Mendez looked thoughtful. "We think Mrs. Mason had help. Did you ever see her with anyone unusual?"</p>
<p class="follow">I recalled the time we saw Natalie's grandma arguing with Dr. Franken. But then again, Mrs. Mason argued with everybody.</p>
<p class="follow">"We saw Mrs. Mason at the college," Poppy said.</p>
<p class="follow">"She volunteers at the campus arboretum," Rose replied.</p>
<p class="follow">"Any idea why she was at the lab when we stopped by?" I asked.</p>
<p class="follow">Rose gave me a sharp glance. "No idea."</p>
<p class="follow">"Or why she was arguing with Dr. Franken?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Dr. Franken didn't have anything to do with Mrs. Mason's death," Rose insisted. "Slim said it was an accident."</p>
<p class="follow">"I said it was an explosion," he said. "From what I could see in the short time I was in the greenhouse, it was an accident."</p>
<p class="follow">"How did you find her?" I asked.</p>
<p class="follow">"My ... unusual circumstances allow me to move about undetected," Slim replied. "I was observing Mrs. Mason in the greenhouse when the explosion occurred."</p>
<p class="follow">"How did it happen?" Poppy asked.</p>
<p class="follow">Mr. Bone said, "It most assuredly happened while Mrs. Mason was practicing magic. The spell to create doppelgangers takes a lot of energy and is quite volatile."</p>
<p class="follow">Slim explained, "The spell got away from her. The whole room took on a green glow. It let out a tremendous amount of heat and then I heard a popping noise as the glass in the greenhouse shattered."</p>
<p class="follow">"Then what happened?" Poppy prompted.</p>
<p class="follow">"Everything went black. When I woke up, I was on the ground and there was fire all around me. I saw a little bit of pink. It was Mrs. Mason's jogging suit. I tried to get her out of there, but she was pinned under a potting table. Just her sneakers were peeking out."</p>
<p class="follow">"Why would she create doppelgangers to create havoc in Nightshade?" I asked. "Especially since she was part of the council."</p>
<p class="follow">"That's a good question," Chief Mendez said. "She'd become bitter in the last few years, since her son, Natalie's father, was killed. She blamed the council for his death, but I never thought she would actually turn against us."</p>
<p class="follow">"Do you think this will be the end of it?" I asked. "What will happen to all the doppelgangers?"</p>
<p class="follow">"I don't know," Slim said."But I don't think Mrs. Mason was working alone."</p>
<p class="follow">"You don't think it was <em>Natalie?</em>" I was horrified by the thought.</p>
<p class="follow">"There's no way," he said. "I'm absolutely sure that it's not Natalie. Her grandmother wouldn't let her near the greenhouse. Besides, Natalie's a good person."</p>
<p class="follow">"Speaking of Natalie," Chief Mendez said, "I'd better find her. Someone needs to tell her about her grandmother's death."</p>
<p class="follow">"I'll go with you," Slim said. "She can stay with me for a few days."</p>
<p class="follow">He and Chief Mendez left. I stood staring after them, thinking about what had just happened.</p>
<p class="follow">I agreed with Slim. It couldn't be Natalie, but, then, who was it? "Maybe now we'll find out who else is out to get the Nightshade City Council," I said. But I wasn't sure we really would. I had a dreadful feeling that, this time, the bad guy had outsmarted all of us.</p>
