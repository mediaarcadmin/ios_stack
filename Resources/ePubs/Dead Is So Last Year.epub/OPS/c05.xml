<h1 class="chaptertitle">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<p class="left"><b><em>On Monday night,</em></b> I was surprised to get a call from Natalie. "Daisy, I have a big favor to ask you," she said. "Could you teach me to cook?"</p>
<p class="follow">"You want to learn to cook from me?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Yes," she said. "I want to surprise Slim by cooking him a special meal, and I've never cooked anything more complicated than Top Ramen."</p>
<p class="follow">I laughed. "Sure, do you have something in mind?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Beef Wellington," she replied. "It's Slim's favorite dish."</p>
<p class="follow">It was a little ambitious for a beginning cook, but I'd try to walk her through it. We made plans to meet at her grandmother's the next evening. I'd never been inside Mrs. Mason's house, although I'd seen the enormous garden and greenhouse in her backyard plenty of times.</p>
<p class="follow">Natalie met me at the door. "I went shopping in San Carlos at that gourmet food store and got everything we need," she said. "And while I was there, I saw this." She waved a piece of paper in my face.</p>

<p class="follow">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="follow">She handed it to me. "It's a cooking contest," she said. "You enter your favorite family recipe. I thought of you right away."</p>
<p class="follow">"Oh," I said. "I've never cooked for anybody besides family and friends before."</p>
<p class="follow">"And the best part is that the grand prize is a trip to Le Cordon Bleu in Paris."</p>
<p class="follow">Paris? That was a great prize.</p>
<p class="follow">"Thanks, Natalie," I said. "Maybe I will enter." I slipped the flyer into my purse. I'd fill it out as soon as I got home. Otherwise, I'd never get it done.</p>
<p class="follow">Natalie and I were in the kitchen preparing the tenderloin when I noticed a large tabby cat observing us silently from the top of the cabinets. Its watchful green eyes were intimidating.</p>
<p class="follow">"I didn't know you had a cat," I said.</p>
<p class="follow">"That's my familiar," Natalie said. "I wish he could go everywhere with me, but unfortunately they don't allow animals in the diner. Not even magical ones."</p>
<p class="follow">Natalie reached up and gave the cat a bit of meat, and he purred gratefully. It made me miss my old cat, Midnight. But it turned out that she was a shifter and therefore not an ideal pet.</p>
<p class="follow">We heard Mrs. Mason arrive home.</p>
<p class="follow">"There's Grandma now," Natalie said. "C'mon. I'll formally introduce you."</p>
<p class="follow">We walked into the living room, where Mrs. Mason stood. She was talking on her cell phone. "But you have to come help me with this," she said into the phone. "I have clothes for theâ€”" She paused as she caught sight of us. "I'll call you back."</p>
<p class="follow">"Grandma, this is Daisy Giordano. I think you know her mother."</p>
<p class="follow">Mrs. Mason frowned. "I didn't realize you had company." There was a huge bag at her feet. She wore a purple tracksuit with a row of fake flowers hot-glued to the collar. I wondered where she kept her wand stashed in those sweats.</p>
<p class="follow">"Daisy's teaching me to cook," Natalie said.</p>
<p class="follow">"I don't see why you won't just whip something up the easy way," her grandmother said, making a motion with her hand.</p>
<p class="follow">Apparently I had been staring curiously, because Mrs. Mason frowned at me. "Donation items," she said, "for my charitable work."</p>
<p class="follow">It was her outfit I'd been focused on, but now I realized that the bag at her feet was filled with men's clothing. "Oh," I said lamely. "That's nice."</p>
<p class="follow">"I'll leave you two girls alone," Mrs. Mason said, picking up the bag. "I'll be in the greenhouse, Natalie, and I'm not to be disturbed."</p>
<p class="follow">"Yes, Grandma," she replied obediently.</p>
<p class="follow">After Mrs. Mason left, Natalie explained, "Grandma is extremely touchy about the greenhouse. Even I'm not allowed inside."</p>
<p class="follow">I briefly wondered why she was taking the clothes with her to do her gardening, but soon got caught up in teaching the basics to Natalie. She hadn't been kidding when she said she'd never cooked before.</p>
<p class="follow">As the pastry for the beef Wellington baked, we chatted about her life back home. Natalie revealed that she'd spent most of her time at school ever since her father died a few years back.</p>
<p class="follow">"That's awful," I said. I knew how it felt to lose a dad. "If you don't mind me asking, how did he die?"</p>
<p class="follow">Natalie took a deep breath. "He was murdered," she said. "By people who found out about his magical abilities. They thought he was a freak. So they killed him."</p>
<p class="follow">I grimaced. I had never heard anything so awful. It was hard to imagine people could be so hateful. "I'm so sorry, Natalie," I said. I wondered if the people who killed her dad could have been part of the Scourge. It was their goal to wipe out paranormals of all kinds.</p>
<p class="follow">She wiped away a single tear and smiled again. "Well, things can only get better, right?" she said. "My grandma's the only family I have left. That's why I'm spending the summer in Nightshade."</p>
<p class="follow">"Did they ever catch who killed him?"</p>
<p class="follow">Natalie shook her head. "My grandmother even alerted the Nightshade City Council when the threats against him started, but by the time the council reached him, it was too late."</p>
<p class="follow">It was past eleven when we finished and Natalie walked me to the door.</p>

<p class="follow">"Thanks so much," she said. "I think I've got it now. Sorry about your arm, though."</p>
<p class="follow">She'd accidentally set down a hot pan a little too close to where I was working and my arm had been burned. "It's nothing," I said. "Don't worry about it."</p>
<p class="follow">"I'm such a klutz," she said with a moan. "Grandma says I can't do anything right."</p>
<p class="follow">I was beginning to not like Mrs. Mason. Natalie, on the other hand, was a sweetheart and I could see why Slim was smitten.</p>
<p class="follow">"It's nothing," I assured her. "Just a little mark, really. It doesn't even hurt." In truth, it was throbbing, but Natalie looked relieved and headed back inside.</p>
<p class="follow">As I stood on the porch, rummaging in my purse for a Band-Aid, a strange green glow appeared. It seemed to be coming from the back of Mrs. Mason's house.</p>
<p class="follow">Snooping was second nature to me, I guess, because I didn't hesitate to investigate. Walking closer, I could see that the light was coming from the greenhouse. I was surprised she was working on her plants so late.</p>
<p class="follow">I crept closer and peered through the doorway. The glass building was stuffed to the gills with plants and flowers, which spilled out of containers. Ferns the size of grown men lined one side. There was moss on the floor and a thick moist heat made it hard for me to breathe. I heard a low groaning noise and stepped into the room.</p>

<p class="follow">Dense foliage partially obstructed my view, but I could see that Mrs. Mason was bent over something on a long wooden table. She mumbled and green sparks flew from the object.</p>
<p class="follow">Without thinking, I gasped, then hid behind a large fern. Mrs. Mason stiffened and wheeled around. She peered into the darkness. I told myself there was no way she could see me, but I felt as if her eyes were boring into me.</p>
<p class="follow">"Who is there?" she cried. She raised her wand menacingly, and for a second, she didn't look like the pleasant elderly woman who took prizes for her roses every year. There were deep lines in her face and her eyes held a dangerous gleam. I didn't move and a minute later, she went back to her work.</p>
<p class="follow">I slipped out while her back was turned, then ran all the way home. What exactly was Mrs. Mason growing in her greenhouse?</p>
<p class="follow">Had I really heard a groan? I'd decided that my imagination was getting the better of me. Mrs. Mason was probably just working on her flowers with magic. The explanation satisfied me and I put the incident out of my mind.</p>
