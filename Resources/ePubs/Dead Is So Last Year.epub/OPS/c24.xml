<h1 class="chaptertitle"><a id='bliopage196'/>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h1>
<p class="left"><b><em>Finally, Poppy said,</em></b> with a falsely bright smile, "Who's hungry? It looks like Slim's is still open."</p>
<p class="follow">I thought food would probably choke me right now, but I played along. "I could use a coffee," I said.</p>
<p class="follow">Ryan kissed the top of my head. "Me, too. I'll see if Dad wants to join us when he's through."</p>
<p class="follow">He went to talk to his dad, and then we headed for the front door of Slim's, right across the street from the precinct. Poppy made a beeline for our favorite table.</p>
<p class="follow">Flo was working and she grabbed a pot of coffee and several cups and brought it over to our table. "I heard you had a rough night," she said.</p>
<p class="follow">"The roughest." I smiled at her gratefully. I was thankful she didn't ask any questions about what had happened. Knowing Flo, she probably already knew the entire story, anyway.</p>
<p class="follow">I heard a giggle and looked over. Natalie was in a corner booth, talking animatedly to what seemed to be nothing, but I knew it was Slim when I heard a deep laugh. He sounded happy. <a id='bliopage197'/>Evidently, she'd gotten over being mad about his spying on her grandmother.</p>
<p class="follow">I whispered to Flo, "I guess they made up?"</p>
<p class="follow">"I guess they did." She sounded gleeful. "You know, Natalie's good for Slim. He's much happier since they started dating. It's not easy being ... different."</p>
<p class="follow">I looked again toward the booth where they sat. "They seem good together."</p>
<p class="follow">"They are," she said. "But Natalie's familiar keeps leaving cat hair all over the bathroom."</p>
<p class="follow">"Cat hair? You mean Natalie's moved in?"</p>
<p class="follow">She nodded. "Still, he's happy. That's what matters."</p>
<p class="follow">After she'd taken our orders, I looked around the table at my friends and family. I wanted to tell all of them what I'd learned in the professor's mucky mind, but I wasn't sure how to talk to them about it.</p>
<p class="follow">A thought struck me. "Dr. Franken admitted she planned to replace council members with doppelgangers."</p>
<p class="follow">" That would mean she would have control over Nightshade's paranormal community," Poppy said.</p>
<p class="follow">"And she'd ruin their reputations while she did it, just for fun," Rose said indignantly.</p>
<p class="follow">I thought about it. "That's probably why DoppelDad was chasing all those girls. To make our real dad look bad."</p>
<p class="follow">"Either that or Dr. Franken planned to murder the real <a id='bliopage198'/>council members and replace them with their doppelgangers," Ryan said grimly.</p>
<p class="follow">Penny Edwards walked in and I wondered why Dr. Franken had chosen to make a double of her. It was obvious to me now that the <em>nice</em> Penny had to be a fake.</p>
<p class="follow">It made me sad to think of it. I liked the Penny Edwards double much better than the real thing.</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy broached the subject that was on all our minds, and none too gently. "So what was DoppelDad talking about when he said he <em>knew</em> Dad was still alive?"</p>
<p class="follow">"I wanted to talk to everyone about that," I replied. I grabbed Ryan's hand for support. "When I was reading Dr. Franken's mind, it confirmed that she was part of the Scourge and they abducted Dad to use his research on paranormal genes. I only had a second, so I didn't find out anything else."</p>
<p class="follow">Rose said, "It's shocking to think that someone at UC Nightshade was involved with the Scourge. Dad probably trusted Dr. Franken, and she gave him up to the enemy."</p>
<p class="follow">There was silence around the table.</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy said softly, "I knew it. I knew he would never leave us. Not willingly."</p>
<p class="follow">"What are we going to do now?" Rose said.</p>
<p class="follow">"Maybe we can get her to talk," I suggested.</p>
<p class="follow">"Or I can make her tell us the hard way," Rose said. My normally sweet sister looked menacing.</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage199'/>We hadn't noticed that Chief Mendez had strolled up to our table until he cleared his throat. "I'm afraid that won't be possible," he said. "Dr. Franken fooled us. It turns out we arrested her doppelganger. By the time the deputy realized his mistake, the real doctor had escaped. We have an APB out, but so far there's no sign of her anywhere."</p>
<p class="follow">"She's probably long gone," Rose said. "I'll bet she's headed for the Scourge's headquarters or one of their safe houses."</p>
<p class="follow">Everyone around the table looked glum. Even the arrival of the food didn't cheer anyone up. Poppy halfheartedly picked at a fry.</p>
<p class="follow">Sean and Samantha rushed in. "We heard there was a fire at the lab," Samantha said. "Is everyone okay?"</p>
<p class="follow">"It's a long story," I told her. "But we're all fine."</p>
<p class="follow">Sean pulled up a couple of chairs and they joined us.</p>
<p class="follow">"Let's look on the bright side," Ryan said. "We know a lot more than we did before. We know your dad is alive, he's been held captive, and that the Scourge is involved. It's a start."</p>
<p class="follow">Rose smiled at him. "It certainly is."</p>
<p class="follow">Nicholas said, "We'll help, Daisy. Everyone will."</p>
<p class="follow">As Ryan had said, it was a start. I finally believed that my father hadn't deserted us. I'd wasted years doubting him, but now it was time to make up for that. We'd look for him. It would be dangerous, taking on the Scourge, but we had our friends and family in Nightshade to help us.</p>
<p class="follow">I slid out of the booth and put a quarter in the jukebox. <a id='bliopage200'/>Maybe Lil had something to tell me, something that I was finally ready to hear.</p>
<p class="follow">"Where's my father?" I said, before punching a random selection. "I Wanna Be Sedated" by the Ramones came on and my shoulders slumped. The jukebox didn't have a clue.</p>
<p class="follow">I went back to the table. "Any luck?" Ryan asked.</p>
<p class="follow">"I don't think so," I said. But then the music cut off and a song I'd never heard came on.</p>
<p class="follow">"What is this?" I said.</p>
<p class="follow">My sisters shrugged, but Chief Mendez answered," 'Working My Way Back to You' by Frankie Valli."</p>
<p class="follow">Rose's cell rang. "Hi, Mom," she said, after looking at the number. "Yes, we're all here."</p>
<p class="follow">She listened, looking stunned. "I'll let <em>you</em> tell them. Hang on while I put you on speaker," she managed to say after a moment.</p>
<p class="follow">Whatever it was, it was big news. Poppy picked up on it, too. "What? What is it?"</p>
<p class="follow">Rose held up the phone with shaking hands. Mom's voice came through loud and clear. "Girls, I'm bringing your father home."</p>
<p class="follow">I think we made all the right noises, but after the phone call ended, we sat there silently, barely daring to hope. Was it possible that the <em>real</em> Rafe Giordano was finally coming home? Was this what my mother's secret mission in Italy had been all about?</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage201'/>I knew that, sooner or later, my father would come back to us and all my questions would be answered. After all, we were in Nightshade and Slim's jukebox had never been wrong before.</p>
<p class="follow">You just had to listen very closely. You had to listen with your heart.</p>
