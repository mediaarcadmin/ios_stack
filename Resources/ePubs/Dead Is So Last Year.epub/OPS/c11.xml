<h1 class="chaptertitle"><a id='bliopage88'/>CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<p class="left"><b><em>My sisters and I</em></b> planned to investigate our newly returned father but, unfortunately, had no idea of his whereabouts. You would think that in a town the size of Nightshade, it would be easy to locate a person, especially someone as infamous as Rafe Giordano, or his look-alike, as the case might be.</p>
<p class="follow">No one was talking, either, except to say stuff like "Daisy, I hear your father is back in town." But after inquiring, I would trace the rumor back to Penny Edwards.</p>
<p class="follow">I was beginning to think he was a figment of my imagination. Still, I was glad Mom wasn't home. I could only imagine the frenzy she would work herself into over this.</p>
<p class="follow">On Friday, Poppy and I were going to have lunch with Rose on campus. I was curious to see where she worked, and besides, we needed to talk about Dad in a place where half the town wouldn't overhear the conversation. The campus was usually fairly deserted in the summer, except for the smaller number of students taking summer classes.</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage89'/>We followed Rose's directions and found the parking lot she had indicated. After that, we made a long trek through the campus grounds. The campus was a hodgepodge of architectural styles. We saw everything from classic brick to seventies modern buildings.</p>
<p class="follow">Rose's lab was located in a building that had seen better days. The paint was peeling in spots and the windows needed washing. We went down a dingy, poorly lit hallway until we found the lab, but the door was locked.</p>
<p class="follow">"What should we do?" I said.</p>
<p class="follow">"Knock," Poppy suggested, "unless you want to send Rose a message telepathically. Or use my cell phone," she added dryly. I'd never thought about it before, but I wondered if it bugged Poppy that Rose and I could communicate nonverbally.</p>
<p class="follow">I tapped lightly on the door, but there was no answer.</p>
<p class="follow">"Pound on it," Poppy instructed. She whipped out her cell and punched in Rose's number. "She's not answering."</p>
<p class="follow">I knocked louder. Still no answer.</p>
<p class="follow">A moment later, the door opened a crack, revealing a woman in a lab coat. She had white cotton-candy hair, and I had to resist the impulse to take a bite.</p>
<p class="follow">"What do you want?" she snapped.</p>
<p class="follow">"Uh, we're here to see Rose Giordano," I said.</p>
<p class="follow">She didn't smile, but the severe look on her face lessened a bit. "You must be her sisters."</p>
<p class="follow">"Yes," Poppy said. "We're supposed to meet her for lunch. Is <a id='bliopage90'/>she here?" She peered through the doorway, but the woman stepped into the hallway and closed the door with a snap, effectively blocking Poppy's view.</p>
<p class="follow">"She left on an errand for me about an hour ago. I'm Dr. Franken."</p>
<p class="follow">After we had introduced ourselves, Rose came rushing up. She was carrying a stack of bakery boxes.</p>
<p class="follow">"Sorry I'm late," she said. To the professor she said, "I went to the Donut Hole, but they were already sold out."</p>
<p class="follow">Dr. Franken frowned. "I'm sure you did your best, my dear."</p>
<p class="follow">"I had to go to three different bakeries, but I managed to get everything on your list."</p>
<p class="follow">The professor cracked a smile. "Excellent." Without another word, she opened the door to the lab and disappeared behind it.</p>
<p class="follow">"Is she always like that?" Poppy said.</p>
<p class="follow">"She's a brilliant scientist," Rose said defensively. "She doesn't have time to stand around and chat."</p>
<p class="follow">"I'm sure she's very busy," I said, trying to avert a fight. "Let's eat. I'm starving."</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy pulled a compact out of her purse and applied a coat of lipstick. "How about the student center?" she suggested. "I want to get to know the campus. After all, I'll be going here in the fall."</p>
<p class="follow">On our walk to the student center, we passed a few people, but for the most part, campus seemed deserted.</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage91'/>Rose gave us a quick tour on the way. "Most of the food court is closed," she explained, "but a couple of the restaurants are still open."</p>
<p class="follow">"Why are they closed?" Poppy asked.</p>
<p class="follow">"Most of the students go home for the summer," Rose explained. "So it's mostly just faculty and staff left. Not too many people enroll in summer session."</p>
<p class="follow">"Oh," Poppy said. She looked crestfallen. "You mean I won't meet any frat guys today?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Doubtful," Rose said, smiling at me. It was nice to see Poppy show an interest in the opposite sex again.</p>
<p class="follow">We made our way to the food court and ordered sandwiches. There were plenty of empty tables, so we took a prime seat by a window, just in case one of Poppy's frat boys wandered by.</p>
<p class="follow">"I can't stay long," Rose said. "Dr. Franken has a project for me this afternoon."</p>
<p class="follow">After we had finished our lunches and Poppy was eying the dessert choices, I asked Rose something I'd been wondering about since we left the lab.</p>
<p class="follow">"What were all the bakery boxes for?"</p>
<p class="follow">She shrugged. "Dunno. Maybe she's hosting a breakfast tomorrow or something."</p>
<p class="follow">It would be kind of odd if she sent Rose out for donuts the day before a breakfastâ€”especially since donuts were best fresh. Maybe Dr. Franken had a weird donut-based eating disorder or something.</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage92'/>"I thought you were her <em>lab</em> assistant," Poppy said, "not her personal assistant."</p>
<p class="follow">"I help with a lot of research," Rose protested. "And besides, Dr. Franken doesn't like to leave the lab."</p>
<p class="follow">"What? You mean like <em>ever?</em>" I thought that was a little odd.</p>
<p class="follow">"Hey, isn't that Mr. Bone?" Poppy said. She pointed to a tan, pudgy man in a polo shirt and khakis moving jerkily up the path toward the student center.</p>
<p class="follow">"What would he being doing on campus?" Rose said.</p>
<p class="follow">The door of the student center opened and Mr. Bone entered.</p>
<p class="follow">"Mr. Bone!" Rose waved at him, but he didn't even notice her. There was a snack kiosk in one corner and he headed for it without looking around. We watched in amazement as he ripped the wrappers off several candy bars and stuffed them into his mouth and then, as quickly as he'd come in, left, before the cashier could react.</p>
<p class="follow">Rose hurried after him, while Poppy and I went to the cashier. Poppy handed him a five-dollar bill. "Will this cover it?"</p>
<p class="follow">After the cashier handed Poppy her change, we raced after Rose and Mr. Bone. We caught up to her, but there was no sign of Mr. Bone anywhere.</p>
<p class="follow">Rose was talking on the phone, obviously to Nicholas.</p>
<p class="follow">"But I'm telling you, it was your dad," she said, then listened a minute.</p>
<p class="follow">"What's he saying?" Poppy said.</p> <p class="follow"><a id='bliopage93'/>"Wait a minute," Rose said. "I can't talk to both of you at once."</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy made a face but quit talking.</p>
<p class="follow">"I think that's a good idea. Daisy and Poppy saw it, too. I'll see you tonight."</p>
<p class="follow">She hung up her phone.</p>
<p class="follow">"Well?" Poppy said.</p>
<p class="follow">"It couldn't have been Mr. Bone," she said.</p>
<p class="follow">"Why not?" I asked.</p>
<p class="follow">"Because," Rose said slowly, "Mr. Bone answered the phone when I called Nicholas at the funeral home."</p>
<p class="follow">We stared at each other.</p>
<p class="follow">"How is that even possible?" Poppy said.</p>
<p class="follow">"Maybe we were wrong," I said. "Maybe whoever it was just resembled Mr. Bone."</p>
<p class="follow">"You're kidding, right?" Poppy said. "That guy was the spitting image of Mr. Bone."</p>
<p class="follow">"Well, he can't be in two places at once, can he?" I challenged, but Poppy didn't have an answer.</p>
<p class="follow">"Where'd Mr. Bone the Second go?" Poppy said.</p>
<p class="follow">"He just disappeared," Rose replied. "He was here one minute and then, <em>poof!</em>"</p>
<p class="follow">We exchanged glances. "He was acting really spacey," I said.</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy said slowly, "And he's not the only one."</p>
<p class="follow">"If I didn't know any better, I'd say Mr. Bone has a clone, just like in one of those science fiction movies," I joked. <a id='bliopage94'/>Rose glared at me. "Don't even joke about that."</p>
<p class="follow">"What?" I was startled by my normally placid sister's temper.</p>
<p class="follow">"About clones," she said. "Human cloning is a very controversial issue. There's no way someone at campus would clone a human being."</p>
<p class="follow">I frowned at her, perplexed. "No one said anything about anyone on campus creating a clone. Besides, I was just joking." Why was she so touchy?</p>
<p class="follow">"I'm sorry, Daisy. I'm a little sensitive. Some people have criticized Dr. Franken about her research methods."</p>
<p class="follow">"What are you trying to say? That Dr. Franken is involved in cloning?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Of course not," she said hotly.</p>
<p class="follow">Rose definitely had some hero worship thing going on with Dr. Franken. I couldn't imagine why, because from what I could see, the doctor didn't treat my sister very well.</p>
<p class="follow">"I'm trying to say that there's something weird going on in Nightshade. Weirder than usual," she said. "And the Nightshade City Council wants our help finding out what that weirdness is."</p>
<p class="follow">An actual invitation to a council meeting? I was thrilled.</p>
