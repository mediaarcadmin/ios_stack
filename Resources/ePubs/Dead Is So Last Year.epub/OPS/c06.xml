<h1 class="chaptertitle"><a id='bliopage57'/>CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<p class="left"><b><em>I was doing laundry</em></b> on Thursday when my cell rang. I checked the number of the caller. It was my boyfriend, and a call from him always made my day better.</p>
<p class="follow">"We haven't been to the new outdoor theater yet. Let's go tonight," Ryan suggested. "Just the two of us."</p>
<p class="follow">I considered the idea. Milk Duds, a dark night, and Ryan. What's not to love?</p>
<p class="follow">"Sounds good. What's playing?" The owner of Nightshade's new outdoor movie theater had a fondness for old horror movies, Vincent Price, Lon Chaney, Bela Lugosi, and stuff like that.</p>
<p class="follow">So I wasn't surprised when Ryan said, "<em>House of Dracula.</em>" I smiled. "It's a date."</p>
<p class="follow">The movie was crowded. A big screen was set upon the pier, close to the Snack Shack, where Poppy worked. The audience members brought blankets and low chairs. People in Nightshade tended to drift in after spending the day at the beach. Or in a <a id='bliopage58'/>coffin. Whichever. I noticed a vampire couple sitting on a blood red blanket in the front.</p>
<p class="follow">I was getting pretty good at telling a paranormal from a norm. The lack of color in the couple's skin was a giveaway that they were of the undead persuasion. And the female vampire was absolutely stunning. She bore a strong resemblance to a silent-movie star from over a hundred years ago. Who knows? Maybe it was her.</p>
<p class="follow">"Want something?" Ryan asked. "I could use a soda." The Snack Shack stayed open late for the summer movie nights.</p>
<p class="follow">"Mmm. Milk Duds and a large root beer, please."</p>
<p class="follow">While he was gone, I people-watched. Obviously, Poppy wasn't working at the concession stand, because I saw her arrive with Candy and put a blanket down right next to a group of cute guys. I waved to them and then said hi to a couple of girls from the cheerleading squad. I relaxed in my lawn chair while I waited for Ryan to get back with the goodies.</p>
<p class="follow">My sense of contentment was shattered a minute later, when I saw Wolfgang Paxton leading a group of rowdy guys to the front. To my surprise, I saw that Sean was at the back of the pack. <em>What is he doing hanging out with those creeps?</em> I thought, then I realized, they were all on the football team.</p>
<p class="follow">Everyone except Wolfgang, of course. And why was Wolfgang their leader?</p>
<p class="follow">Unfortunately, there was no sign of Bane, who seemed to be able to keep his brother in line.</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage59'/>Wolfie shoved his way in front of a little girl and knocked a box of candy out of her hand. He didn't even pause to say sorry, and all the rest of the guys followed without looking her way. All the guys except Sean, who picked up the candy and handed it to her before continuing on his way.</p>
<p class="follow">Sean was wearing a light shirt and shorts. His muscles looked like they had muscles. I frowned. He'd bulked up a lot since I'd seen him last.</p>
<p class="follow">Wolfie and his crew flopped down behind the vampire couple. Wolfie leaned forward and whispered something to the female vampire. Her shoulders stiffened, but she kept her gaze firmly on the screen, even though the previews hadn't started yet.</p>
<p class="follow">"Did I miss anything?" Ryan handed me my soda and box of candy.</p>
<p class="follow">"Not on the screen, but Wolfie looks like he's about to start something."</p>
<p class="follow">We watched as Wolfie reached out and touched the female vampire's hair. She ignored him, but the male vampire turned in a flash, his fangs bared and fists clenched.</p>
<p class="follow">In response, Wolfie and his pals jumped to their feet. Fortunately, an usher came by and politely suggested that they find a spot far away from the couple.</p>
<p class="follow">After a tense second, Wolfie got up and moved several rows back from the couple. His buddies followed.</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage60'/>Ryan leaned forward until his breath tickled my ear. "That usher's dad is the head of a very powerful Were pack outside San Carlos. Even Wolfie's not stupid enough to mess with him."</p>
<p class="follow">Apparently, Ryan was plugged into the whole Were community now. It gave me a pang to realize he had a whole life that I wasn't a part of, not really.</p>
<p class="follow">He was right, though. At least it seemed as though Wolfie had calmed down. The movie started without any further interruptions.</p>
<p class="follow">But halfway through the movie, Wolfie started throwing candy at the vampire couple. There were a couple of loud snickers. The male vampire turned around, and in the dark, his eyes were lit with a red fire.</p>
<p class="follow">"I advise you to stop that, Paxton cub," he said in a loud voice. "If I didn't know who your father and brother were, your throat would already be torn out."</p>
<p class="follow">Wolfie stood and his cronies followed suit. All but Sean, who looked like he wanted to be anywhere but where he was.</p>
<p class="follow">"This is the kind of trouble we don't need," Ryan said. "I'll be right back."</p>
<p class="follow">The entire movie audience held its collective breath as Wolfie made a slight movement toward the vampires.</p>
<p class="follow">I had to do something. No time like the present to practice a little telekinesis. I concentrated and Wolfie's extra-large soda <a id='bliopage61'/>flew out of his hand and landed upside down on his head, showering him with icy cola.</p>
<p class="follow">Ryan threw an amused glance my way but continued to where Wolfgang and the others were. "You," he said in a measured voice. "Out." He grabbed Wolfie's arm and twisted it behind his back. His gaze encompassed the rest of the team. "All of you. Now. And don't come back."</p>
<p class="follow">Ryan marched Wolfie up the pier. Wolfgang's eyes burned into mine as he passed me, but he didn't say a word.</p>
<p class="follow">Sean was the last in line. I grabbed his arm. "What are you doing with those guys, Sean?" I knew they were all on the football team together, but Sean was hanging withâ€”well, frankly, the creeps of the bunch. And besides, Sean was a senior and Wolfie was a freshman.</p>
<p class="follow">He shrugged off my arm. "Stay out of it, Daisy."</p>
<p class="follow">"Sean!"</p>
<p class="follow">But he ignored me and continued after his buddies. I waited a couple of minutes and then followed. I wanted to make sure Ryan was okay. He was a werewolf, but so was Wolfgang and who knew who else in that little group.</p>
<p class="follow">There was no sign of them on the other end of the pier, but I caught a glimpse of Ryan standing behind the Snack Shack.</p>
<p class="follow">"Is everything okay?" I asked. Wolfgang and his group were gone, all except Sean, who was looking down at the ground when I approached.</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage62'/>"Everything is fine," Ryan assured me. "I just need five minutes alone with Sean.</p>
<p class="follow">I grabbed his arm and pulled him a few feet away, hopefully out of Sean's earshot.</p>
<p class="follow">"You're not going to fight him?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Of course not. He's my best friend. I'm just going to try to talk some sense into him.</p>
<p class="follow">He gave me a quick kiss and then I went back to my seat, but it took Ryan longer than five minutes to rejoin me. In fact, the movie was almost over by the time he slid into the lawn chair next to me.</p>
<p class="follow">"Sorry, he said. "I didn't mean for that to take so long. He looked grim.</p>
<p class="follow">"Is Sean okay? I whispered.</p>
<p class="follow">"Stubborn, but he's okay. I think I got through to him about being a little more selective about who he hangs out with. Ryan took my hand. "I'm really sorry, Daisy. I'll make it up to you.</p>
<p class="follow">The movie ended a few minutes later, but I hadn't really been paying attention, anyway. I was more concerned about Ryan, and how could I be mad at him for trying to help Sean?</p>
<p class="follow">I didn't want our date to end on such a down note. "I'll forgive you if you forgive me.</p>
<p class="follow">Ryan looked startled. "For what?</p>
<p class="follow">"I ate all the Milk Duds. And the popcorn," I joked, and was relieved when he cracked a smile. It was a small one, but it was a beginning.</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage63'/>"Then you can buy me a slice of pie at Slim's, he replied.</p>
<p class="follow">"As much as I love that place, I've been spending all my time there. I'm pretty sure we still have some apple pie left at my house. And no one's home.</p>
<p class="follow">"Even better, Ryan said, as we walked out of the theater. And it was.</p>
