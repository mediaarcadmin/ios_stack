<h1 class="chaptertitle">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h1>
<p class="left"><b><em>It was completely silent</em></b> in the lab for a minute. But then there was a knock on the laboratory door, and Chief Mendez's voice came through. "Dr. Franken, open up. I have a few questions for you."</p>
<p class="follow">I heard Dr. Franken say in a low voice, "It's locked and barricaded. That'll give us a few minutes. Through the tunnel and hurry. Giordano, you know what to do."</p>
<p class="follow">At first I thought she was talking to me, but then I realized that she called all the doubles by the last name of the original. She was talking to my DoppelDad.</p>
<p class="follow">The lab was still dark and I could only make out hazy shapes, but I heard the sounds of Dr. Franken's creations exiting. I thought they'd all gone, but then I heard the sound of something being poured and the snick of a lighter.</p>
<p class="follow">"You've got to be kidding me!" I said. "They're actually going to set fire to the lab. With us still in it?"</p>
<p class="follow">Dr. Franken said, "You always were a smart girl." I saw her face after she lit a match. Then she threw it but didn't watch to see if it caught. She headed for the tunnel.</p>
<p class="follow">Time to use the powers Poppy had been coaching me on. To my relief, I managed to move the fire extinguisher across the room and get it to douse the flame before it reached the pool of what I suspected was a highly combustible chemical or plain old gasoline. From the smell, I gathered Dr. Franken had gone the traditional route: Gas.</p>
<p class="follow">I needed to do something, anything. Anything besides panic, that is.</p>
<p class="follow">Ryan and I needed to leave, but our choices were following the doctor through the tunnel or exiting the lab some other way.</p>
<p class="follow">Our best chance was to move the barricades from in front of the lab door. I concentrated, hard, and then finally, the heavy tables skidded across the floor. The door was still locked, but I could hear Chief Mendez giving orders.</p>
<p class="follow">There was a pause and then the sound of footsteps returning. Dr. Franken back to finish the job?</p>
<p class="follow">Instead, my DoppelDad approached me. "Daisy, I'm going to untie you and your friend. But you can't go out the tunnel with me. It's not safe. You'll have to find another way out."</p>
<p class="follow">I showed him my hands. "Already taken care of."</p>
<p class="follow">I felt a pang when he touched my face. "That's my girl."</p>
<p class="follow">"I'm not, though, am I?"</p>
<p class="follow">He looked at me a moment. "No," he replied. "But I wish you were."</p>
<p class="follow">I dug into my pocket and handed him the cookie. "For the road."</p>
<p class="follow">He took it from me with a smile. "Thank you."</p>
<p class="follow">"You'd better go," I said.</p>
<p class="follow">Just then the door burst open and Chief Mendez walked in, followed by Samantha's dad.</p>
<p class="follow">DoppelDad launched himself at the tunnel opening and disappeared.</p>
<p class="follow">"We've got to get out of here," I said. "There are chemicals everywhere and Dr. Franken poured gas all over the furniture."</p>
<p class="follow">We ran out of the building and retreated to a safe distance at the end of the street.</p>
<p class="follow">Chief Mendez was on his radio calling for fire trucks and for safety personnel to evacuate the building. The fire was out, but there were still volatile chemicals in the room.</p>
<p class="follow">"What about Dr. Franken and the doubles?" I asked Ryan's dad.</p>
<p class="follow">"I already have men stationed at the mouth of the tunnel. They'll get them when they emerge," he replied.</p>
<p class="follow">Sam's dad said, "Daisy, remember, he's not your father. He may look like him, but he's just a copy." I wasn't sure who he was trying to convince, me or himself.</p>
<p class="follow">"I know, Mr. Devereaux."</p>

<p class="follow">I had something to tell my family, something I'd discovered when reading Dr. Franken's mind, but I wanted to wait until my mom was home, too. Maybe the news would wipe the sad look off Poppy's face. She'd been convinced that Dad's double was the real thing, I was sure of it.</p>
<p class="follow">Ryan and I hitched a ride back downtown with Samantha's dad. I called my sisters on the way and gave them a rundown of what had happened. Mr. Devereaux slowed in front of the police station, where all the action seemed to be.</p>
<p class="follow">We parked the car and hopped out.</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy and Rose were already there, standing at the edge of a crowd, who were all watching the drama unfold.</p>
<p class="follow">"What's happening?" I said.</p>
<p class="follow">"They've arrested Dr. Franken for attempted murder and a bunch of other things," Poppy said. "They're taking her to the state police station."</p>
<p class="follow">Deputy Denton had Dr. Franken in cuffs. He put her in the squad car and drove off. But no one seemed to know what to do about the doubles. Without their leader, the doubles milled around the station parking lot, surrounded by wary-looking police. Mort's double was still whining about being hungry, and his complaints were getting louder and louder.</p>
<p class="follow">I noticed Mr. Devereaux avoided looking at the double of my dad. DoppelDad gave me a little wave when he saw us, but his hand was trembling. The rest of the doubles looked to be in worse shape. Some of them were holding their stomachs and groaning.</p>
<p class="follow">DoppelDad dashed next door to the donut shop and started rummaging through the garbage.</p>
<p class="follow">Ryan said, "What is he doing?"</p>
<p class="follow">DoppelDad was dumpster-diving again. <em>Eeww.</em> The other doppels followed suit.</p>
<p class="follow">"What's wrong with them?" Rose said in horror.</p>
<p class="follow">"They're hungry," I said. "I think they need sugar."</p>
<p class="follow">Ryan said, "I'll go buy a box of donuts. That should tide them over."</p>
<p class="follow">I smiled at him gratefully. DoppelDad was a phony, but I didn't want him to suffer.</p>
<p class="follow">That reminded me. I needed to tell my sisters what I'd discovered when I dipped into Dr. Franken's mind. I pulled them aside, but before I could spill it, Mort's double collapsed.</p>
<p class="follow">Like a row of bowling pins, the rest of the doppelgangers fell to the ground. DoppelDad was the last to fall. I rushed to his side, with Rose and Poppy swift on my heels.</p>
<p class="follow">I grabbed DoppelDad's hand. "Ryan will be here any minute, with donuts. Just hang on!"</p>
<p class="follow">"It's too late," he said. "But Daisy, I want you to know I was proud to be your dad, even though I'm not the real thing."</p>
<p class="follow">I choked back a sob. It was awful to see them all suffering like this. How could Dr. Franken do such a thing?</p>

<p class="follow">"And there's one more thing," he said. "Your father, your real one, I mean. He's—"</p>
<p class="follow">"Shh. Don't talk," I said. "I know, he's still alive."</p>
<p class="follow">"How did you know?" he wheezed.</p>
<p class="follow">"Dr. Franken's mind was full of information. I'm psychic, remember?" I gave Rose a guilty look. I hadn't had a chance to tell her.</p>
<p class="follow">"The Scourge," he said. "Did you find out where—" His sentence ended on a gasp and he fell silent.</p>
<p class="follow">I looked around. The doppelgangers were all slowly melting. Within minutes, most of them had disappeared completely.</p>
<p class="follow">Ryan came back, carrying a pink box, which he dropped as the last doppelganger, my DoppelDad, disappeared. I saw tears cascading down my sisters' cheeks.</p>
<p class="follow">Ryan put his arms around me. "What happened?"</p>
<p class="follow">"They just all evaporated." I choked back a tear.</p>
<p class="follow">Rose said, "There must have been a weakness in their makeup."</p>
<p class="follow">"They all were jonesing hard for sugar right before they died," I said. "I think Dr. Franken hadn't been feeding them properly."</p>
<p class="follow">"At the lab, they were all complaining that they were starving," Ryan added.</p>
<p class="follow">Then everyone fell silent. We stayed there until the crowd left, not talking. It was late, but none of us felt like going home. No one felt like doing anything.</p>
