<h1 class="chaptertitle"><a id='bliopage64'/>CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<p class="left"><b><em>It mas Friday night.</em></b> I had decided to stay home and hang out with Poppy, who still had days awash in tears, mourning the loss of Gage.</p>
<p class="follow">Since I was staying home, Ryan had planned a night out with the guys. Rose was working late at the lab, so Poppy and I headed to the video store.</p>
<p class="follow">"How about this one? Poppy said. She gestured toward one of the more gory selections in the horror section.</p>
<p class="follow">I wrinkled my nose. "How about something with less slash and more suspense?</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy wandered into the next aisle. A minute later, she came back waving a DVD. "We're going to watch this tonight."</p>
<p class="follow">I peered at the movie in her hand. "<em>Truly, Madly, Deeply?</em> What's it about?"</p>
<p class="follow">"You'll love it," she replied, but she didn't meet my eyes.</p>
<p class="follow">I read the description on the back. "A ghost? You want to watch a movie about a doomed love affair with a ghost?"</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage65'/>"I miss him, Daisy," she said softly, "but I know he's not coming back. As a ghost or anything else."</p>
<p class="follow">I frowned." I don't think—"</p>
<p class="follow">"It's not any different from when Rose watched <em>An American Werewolf in London</em> over and over that time she and Nicholas broke up," Poppy pointed out.</p>
<p class="follow">My sister and Nicholas had broken up when they were high school sweethearts. Rose didn't know it at the time, but he had broken up with her because he was having a hard time dealing with being a Were, not because he didn't care about her. They were back together and seemed to have resolved all their relationship issues.</p>
<p class="follow">I couldn't resist Poppy's pleading eyes." Okay, but I get to pick one, too."</p>
<p class="follow">"The werewolf movies are over there," she said.</p>
<p class="follow">I smiled to see Poppy kidding around again, but on impulse, I grabbed a couple of older werewolf movies and then we checked out and headed for home.</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy wanted to watch <em>Truly, Madly, Deeply</em> first, so I popped it into the machine and settled on the couch next to her. By the end of the movie, we both had reached for the tissues.</p>
<p class="follow">I clicked off the movie. "You know what we need?"</p>
<p class="follow">"More tissues?" Poppy joked, but her eyes were still watery.</p>
<p class="follow">"No, chocolate," I said. "Let's make brownies. With the good chocolate."</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage66'/>We still had some of the chocolate we'd brought back from Europe, although, thanks to me, not very much of it was left.</p>
<p class="follow">But it was enough for me to whip up some truly delicious brownies.</p>
<p class="follow">"You know, I've really been enjoying cooking the old-fashioned way lately," I said as I stirred the batter. "But my telekinesis might come in handy at Slim's during a rush."</p>
<p class="follow">"Have you tried to hone your powers at all?"</p>
<p class="follow">I thought about her question. "Not really. I've been busy." I hoped she didn't ask doing what. Summer was for relaxing, right? "I did dump soda on Wolfgang the other night at the movies, using my powers."</p>
<p class="follow">"I <em>thought</em> that was you," she said.</p>
<p class="follow">"He deserved it," I replied.</p>
<p class="follow">She chuckled. "Of course he did, but it doesn't pay to get rusty," Poppy said. "Especially not in Nightshade."</p>
<p class="follow">She had a point. I poured the batter into the pan and put it into the oven, then gave her a beater to lick.</p>
<p class="follow">"Why don't we practice now? We have about half an hour before the brownies are done."</p>
<p class="follow">We went outside, where the night sky was sharp with stars. The moon was out, but I noted with relief that it wasn't full yet.</p>
<p class="follow">I faced Poppy. "So, what now?" She'd been helping me train to improve the control of my telekinesis ever since we'd found out about it, but it had been awhile since I'd put in any real work.</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage67'/>"Let's try something different," she said. "Try to open the front door, using your mind."</p>
<p class="follow">It took me about fifteen minutes, which meant I really <em>was</em> rusty, but I finally managed to do it.</p>
<p class="follow">"You're horribly out of practice," Poppy scolded me. "You've got to work at it, Daisy."</p>
<p class="follow">As she was lecturing me, I heard the howl of a wolf, which was not all that unusual in Nightshade, considering our werewolf population. It was followed by several other howls, closer this time.</p>
<p class="follow">I stared up at the moon." Look, it's not even full."</p>
<p class="follow">She shrugged. "No big deal. Rose isn't with Nicholas. She's on campus. And besides, Nicholas has a lot of control."</p>
<p class="follow">"Yes, but Ryan's out with the guys tonight," I said. As a new werewolf, the last thing my boyfriend should be doing was socializing this close to a full moon. He hadn't completely figured out how to handle the transformation yet, and teen wolves often shifted even when the moon wasn't full.</p>
<p class="follow">A minute later, the howls had turned to snarls and the sounds were coming closer. "It sounds like they're chasing something."</p>
<p class="follow">"It's not like they're right next door or anything," she said.</p>
<p class="follow">But she was wrong. I caught the gleam of red eyes in the darkness.</p>
<p class="follow">"Poppy," I said, "I think it's time we went inside. Now."</p>
<p class="follow">"But we just..." She trailed off when she saw my face. <a id='bliopage68'/>There was a snarl and then a werewolf appeared out of the bushes about twenty feet in front of us. We weren't entertaining just one werewolf. From my count, it looked like a whole pack. I tried to shake off my paralyzing fear.</p>
<p class="follow">"Move slowly," I cautioned her, but Poppy was already bolting for the door.</p>
<p class="follow">She'd nearly reached it when a blur of fur and snapping teeth launched itself at her back. I put up a hand, and the next thing I knew, a heavy flowerpot flew across the yard and hit the wolf squarely on the nose. He dropped to the ground, panting and whimpering, but out of the corner of my eye, I saw another wolf creep forward.</p>
<p class="follow">I sprinted to the door and made it inside with seconds to spare. I slammed the door and turned the lock, and Poppy and I stood trembling in our foyer. We waited, but there was only silence outside. Then we finally heard the sound of the pack running into the night. I sagged against the door frame.</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy took a shaky breath. "What the heck was that all about?" she said.</p>
<p class="follow">"I don't know," I said. "But I think they were young wolves—teenagers maybe. They have to be. Why else would they shift when it's not even a full moon?" There was something still puplike about a couple of the wolves.</p>
<p class="follow">"There aren't that many young werewolves in Nightshade, are there?" <a id='bliopage69'/>I thought about it, then counting on my fingers, I listed them. "There's Nicholas, Bane Paxton and his little brother, Wolfgang, Elise Wilder, and Ryan. That's all I can think of."</p>
<p class="follow">"That's only five," Poppy said. "But you saw a lot more, didn't you?"</p>
<p class="follow">I nodded. "I think there were at least eight of them." "Maybe they're out-of-towners," Poppy offered. A terrible thought occurred to me. "Or maybe..."</p>
<p class="follow">"What?"</p>
<p class="follow">"Maybe someone is increasing the werewolf population." "How does that happen?"</p>
<p class="follow">I shrugged. My werewolf boyfriend hadn't been exactly forthcoming about the particulars.</p>
<p class="follow">"Ryan might know something," Poppy said.</p>
<p class="follow">"He'd never do something like that!" I defended him. "Nicholas, either."</p>
<p class="follow">"Of course not." Poppy rolled her eyes. "I meant that since Ryan is a werewolf, he might know or could help us find out more about it." She shuddered. "Those wolves were on the hunt. I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't hit that one when you did."</p>
<p class="follow">"I'll ask Ryan," I told her, "the first chance I get." I didn't want him to think I was a scaredy-cat, so I decided to tell him in the morning.</p>
<p class="follow">I didn't realize that it would be some time before I saw him again.</p>
