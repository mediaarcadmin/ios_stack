<h1 class="chaptertitle"><a id='bliopage140'/>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>
<p class="left"><b><em>I had resolved</em></b> to get up early to call Mom but didn't wake until almost noon. It was nice to be able to sleep in. Grandma had gone to some volunteer committee luncheon and the house was quiet. I calculated the time difference. It was almost nine <span style="font-size: smaller">P.M.</span> in Italy, but I knew Mom would still be up. She worked long hours at home, so I was sure she'd be doing the same in Italy.</p>
<p class="follow">She answered her cell on the first ring. "Daisy, can I call you back? I'm in the middle of something." She was talking so softly that I could barely hear her.</p>
<p class="follow">"I wouldn't bother you while you're working, but it's important."</p>
<p class="follow">"Okay," she replied, "but you'll have to talk fast." There was a strange clanking noise in the background.</p>
<p class="follow">"Dad's back in town," I said baldly.</p>
<p class="follow">"What?" she sounded breathless.</p>
<p class="follow">"He just showed up in Nightshade and moved in with us," I said. "Grandma's staying with us, too."</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage141'/>"Are you sure he's your father?" she asked. I was taken aback by the surprise in her voice. I thought Mom would be the first person to assume he was the real deal.</p>
<p class="follow">"I read his mind and he has Dad's memories, butâ€”"</p>
<p class="follow">She interrupted me. "He can't be your dad, Daisy," she said. "It's just not possible. Get him out of the house. <em>Now.</em>"</p>
<p class="follow">I got goose bumps from her tone of voice. I figured my mom's psychic abilities had kicked in over the phone and she could sense the truth about the situation. Her insistence, coupled with Mr. Devereaux's, had me convinced.</p>
<p class="follow">"I'll make sure he leaves," I said. "And I'll change the locks."</p>
<p class="follow">"Good," said Mom. "Now, I'll be out of touch for the next few days. There's no cell phone service where I'm going."</p>
<p class="follow">"Where are you going?" I asked.</p>
<p class="follow">"I can't talk about that," she said in a low voice. "But Daisy, you and your sisters need to be on your guard. I'll be home as soon as I can." The phone clicked and I realized she'd hung up on me.</p>
<p class="follow">I stared at the phone. Something was going on with Mom.</p>
<p class="follow">Next, I dialed Poppy and Rose at work and filled them in on what Mom had said. Even Poppy couldn't argue with the fact that Mom was usually right. Rose advised me to call Chief Mendez to come to the house for DoppelDad.</p>
<p class="follow">As far as I knew, he was still asleep upstairs, after another one of his late nights. But just as I was about to dial the police <a id='bliopage142'/>station, I heard a noise behind me. I turned, and there he was. DoppelDad had heard everything.</p>
<p class="follow">I gasped. I hoped I hadn't made him mad, talking about him behind his back. Who knew what an angry doppelganger was capable of? But DoppelDad just looked more hurt than anything. He turned and ran off, slamming the front door behind him.</p>
<p class="follow">Problem solved?</p>
<p class="follow">I called Chief Mendez and spilled the whole story, anyway, but DoppelDad was nowhere to be found by the time he got to the house. I kicked myself for not calling him earlier. Now that stranger who looked like my dad was on the loose in Nightshade doing who knows what.</p>
<p class="follow">I paced around the house all day, waiting for my sisters to get home from work so I wouldn't feel so vulnerable. Poppy got home first. When our big sister finally made it home from the lab, it was late.</p>
<p class="follow">"What took you so long?" Poppy said. She was sprawled out on the couch, cell phone still in hand. She'd spent the evening texting her friend Candy, but when Rose finally showed up, she clicked off the phone. "Daisy and I have been waiting forever."</p>
<p class="follow">I took a closer look at Rose's face. It was drawn and pale.</p>
<p class="follow">"Poppy, shut up for a second, will you? Can't you see something's wrong?"</p>
<p class="follow">Rose drew a shaky breath.</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage143'/>"Rose, sit down. What happened?"</p>
<p class="follow">She took a seat on the couch next to Poppy. "Dr. Franken fired me today."</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy's jaw dropped.</p>
<p class="follow">I had a similar reaction, but also knew Rose was badly shaken up. "I'll make you some tea and then you can tell us all about it."</p>
<p class="follow">After making Rose's favorite tea, I added some biscotti to the tray and hurried back into the living room.</p>
<p class="follow">Rose had had a shock. A little sugar would be good for her. She'd never been fired from anything before. She was a perfect student and employee.</p>
<p class="follow">I handed Rose her cup, then set the tray down on the ottoman between us.</p>
<p class="follow">Poppy snagged a biscotti and munched down happily. I smacked her hand. "Those are for Rose."</p>
<p class="follow">"There are plenty," she responded, and then stuck out her tongue at me. It was good to see a little of the old Poppy, even if it meant putting up with a little attitude.</p>
<p class="follow">"Do you know why she fired you?" I asked.</p>
<p class="follow">"That's the horrible part," Rose said. "I don't, not really. Dr. Franken was sweet as pie at first. And she's so brilliant that I didn't even mind all those frivolous errands she sent me on sometimes."</p>
<p class="follow">"What changed?"</p>
<p class="follow">"I don't know," Rose replied. "She asked about Dad a few <a id='bliopage144'/>weeks ago, and I didn't think anything of it. But then he stopped by the lab today. He looked upset."</p>
<p class="follow">"That must have been after he heard me on the phone." I groaned.</p>
<p class="follow">"They went into the back room of the lab together for a few minutes," Rose continued.</p>
<p class="follow">"Did you follow them?" Poppy asked.</p>
<p class="follow">Rose shook her head. "No, I'm not allowed in that part of the lab. But I heard them talking. He mentioned my name."</p>
<p class="follow">I wondered why that part of the lab was off-limits, but I let my sister continue her story.</p>
<p class="follow">"When Dr. Franken came out, I told her that the person she was talking to wasn't Rafe Giordano, that he was an impostor," Rose said. "I was just trying to help, but Dr. Franken went berserk. She called me a liar. She said she didn't want me working in her lab anymore."</p>
<p class="follow">"Dr. Franken is a friend of Dad's," Poppy said. "It makes sense that she would defend him."</p>
<p class="follow">"Not really," I said. I went on to tell my sisters what Mr. Devereaux had told me about Dad's relationship with Dr. Franken.</p>
<p class="follow">"Well, she sure seemed offended by my calling him a fake," Rose said. "I felt like they were conspiring against me. On my way out of the lab, DoppelDad peeked out from the back and smirked at me. Like he wanted me to be fired."</p>
<p class="follow">"Doppelgangers do create chaos," I reminded Rose.</p>
<p class="follow">"They sure do," she said, looking crestfallen.</p>
