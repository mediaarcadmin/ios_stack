<h1 class="chaptertitle">ALEC</h1>
<p class="left"><b>L</b><span style="font-size: smaller">ET ME TELL YOU</span> a story, said Alec to Lucia.</p>
<p class="follow">My father was elected to the Senate when he was young, not yet thirty-five years old. He had the bearing, one might say the standing, of a much older man. He habitually wore three-piece suits, a gold watch chain strung across the vest, but the Phi Beta Kappa key that went with the chain he left at home. His hair was prematurely gray and his voice a confidential baritone, quite soft. He won in an upset against an unpopular Republican, sullen, unclubbable. That was what the political community was then, a club. Everyone knew each other. So word preceded my father: sound man, reliable, tended to business. A workhorse, not a show horse. Good poker player, knew when to hold and knew when to fold, and so forth. Everyone liked Kim Malone, he was in for the long haul, a serious man. I never knew him to listen to a baseball game or read a novel. His world was politics, specifically the Senate. He spent the ten weeks between the election and the inauguration reading the Senate rule book because he knew that the rules were the keys to the realm. The consequence was that from the beginning he was an inside man, drinks in the majority leader's office after hours, golf with committee chairmen on the weekends. After a year or so he became friendly with members of the White House staff and eventually the president himself. Kim Malone knew how to return a favor and keep his mouth shut. He never spoke to the newspapers until much later in his career, when it became unavoidable, and to his advantage.</p>
<p class="follow">This occurred when I was very small, seven years old, a Saturday afternoon in summer. My mother explained that she had a bridge tournament and my father would look after me. We drove to the Senate Office Building in her convertible, the top down. The day was very warm, heat rising in waves from the asphalt. The empty lobby was cool and our voices echoed in the great space. We mounted the marble staircase to my father's second-floor office. When we walked into his reception room there was no one about and the door to his private office was closed. My mother was not put off by closed doors so she knocked once and walked in to find my father with a visitor, the two of them in close conversation around his desk. He looked up with an expression of open alarm. Of course he had forgotten that I was his responsibility for the afternoon. I remember that he and my mother had a quick word sotto voce and that he gave her shoulder a squeeze before he kissed her and wished her good luck and asked her to telephone when she had news. They're better players than I am, my mother said. No they're not, he said. And call me, please. She left at once and I was directed to the leather couch and told to make myself comfortable and not make one sound.</p>
<p class="follow">You can take your jacket off, my father added with a wink to his visitor.</p>
<p class="follow">The visitor was staring at me with a baffled look. What was I doing there, a child in a senator's private office on a Saturday afternoon? Didn't I have anything better to do? The Senate wasn't even in session. It was as if the lion tamer had entered the cage to find not a lion but a white rabbit. To cover his confusion the visitor lit a cigarette, though he already had one burning in the ashtray.</p>
<p class="follow">Say hello to Mr. James, my father said.</p>
<p class="follow">Hello, Mr. James.</p>
<p class="follow">Mr. James works for the president.</p>
<p class="follow">Hello, Alec, Mr. James said, and blew a smoke ring that seemed to hang in the air forever, and a second to follow the first.</p>
<p class="follow">I took off my jacket. My mother had dressed me up in a blazer and short pants, white shirt, brown oxfords, because we were visiting the Senate Office Building. Both my father and Mr. James were in suits and ties. They had drinks in their hands. My father rose heavily and went to the sideboard to pour me a soda. He and Mr. James returned to their discussion, of which I understood very little except there was an absent party and this man was not a friend. There was a reservation somewhere and he had gone off it. He was not thinking of the national interest but of his own interest and it was urgent that he be brought to heel at once or there would be hell to pay and he would pay it. Mr. James was talking and my father was listening, not altogether comfortably. Mr. James was not a prepossessing man. He was painfully thin with a bony face and a gray complexion. He looked exhausted, as if he had not slept in weeks, whereas my father was heavy-set, pink-cheeked, the picture of good health. Yet the force in the room was Mr. James. The tension between my father and his visitor was palpable. Then suddenly Mr. James had a coughing fit and had to turn away, his hand to his mouth. He was so frail. He stopped the coughing fit by lighting another cigarette but there was no smoke ring this time.</p>
<p class="follow">We're counting on you, Kim.</p>
<p class="follow">It's difficult, my father said.</p>
<p class="follow">The Boss wants it.</p>

<p class="follow">I know he does, my father said.</p>
<p class="follow">If not, I intend to piss on the son of a bitch. And others'll get wet.</p>
<p class="follow">Timmy, my father said. But he was smiling now.</p>
<p class="follow">You know I'm right, Kim.</p>
<p class="follow">I'll speak to him, my father said.</p>
<p class="follow">It's going to have to be more than talk.</p>
<p class="follow">I can't put a gun to his head, Timmy.</p>
<p class="follow">The hell you can't. He's a goddamned traitor. Tell him I said that.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm not going to say that to him.</p>
<p class="follow">Tell him the Boss said it.</p>
<p class="follow">My father took a swallow of his drink and did not reply.</p>
<p class="follow">We'll be grateful.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm sure you will be, my father said. And then he cleared his throat and leaned close to Mr. James and said something I could not hear but whatever it was Mr. James smiled and lit another cigarette.</p>
<p class="follow">I was there for a long time and began to daydream. I always wondered if I acquired my taste for daydreams in my father's office that day, listening to him and his visitor talk about the senator who had gone away from his reservation and had to be brought back, forcibly if need be. On the mantel opposite me was an old pendulum clock. Each tick seemed to have the resonance of a pistol shot, and when the minute hand advanced it did so with a sharp click. I was hypnotized by the clock, sixty pistol shots punctuated by the click when the minute hand jumped forward. I believe in that way I came to conceive of time not as a smooth evolution but as a series of abrupt progressions, relentless and unsurprising so long as you anticipated the sharp click. I would say that was my introduction to the modern world, except really I was just a little boy sitting on a leather couch listening to two men of government trying to settle a score. Then Mr. James raised his voice and said one last thing that I do remember word for word. He said, Of course I'm playing politics. What else would I do? I play politics the way Caruso sings Puccini. With a damn sight more at stake.</p>
<p class="follow">What were they talking about? Lucia asked.</p>
<p class="follow">I have no idea, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Did you ever ask your father?</p>
<p class="follow">Never did. I like mysteries.</p>
<p class="follow">Really?</p>
<p class="follow">Yes. Definitely.</p>
<p class="follow">I like your story, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">I told you so that you could know me better.</p>
<p class="follow">I know you pretty well. We're to be married after all.</p>
<p class="follow">I want you to know how I grew up. Sitting in my father's office watching Timmy James blow smoke rings and threaten to piss on a United States senator. But that's my father's world, not mine. I was never attracted to Washington the way my parents were and perhaps that's because they were from someplace else. They were immigrants. Union Station was their Ellis Island, the Lincoln Memorial their Statue of Liberty. Most everyone in Washington is from someplace else but soon enough they switch allegiance. And they do not acknowledge this allegiance shift when they visit their former home because the residents there are outsiders. They are civilians and they wouldn't understand the reinvention of self. More to the point, they would not understand the mystery of government. How it works actually, the rules and regs, the greater arcana. My father called it "the privilege" of public service. Washingtonians, at least the Washingtonians I'm talking about, feel closer to the pulse of things than other people do. Election returns come in and your neighbor across the street finds himself without a job and the next day or the day after you drop by for a drink and the talk is subdued because of the corpse in the parlor. He's still your friend but he isn't the same friend because he's an ex. Ex-senator. Ex-congressman. And when you're out, you're out. There are no second acts in American politics unless your name is Nixon. So you say goodbye to the cloakroom and become a lobbyist or of counsel to a law firm and they're the same thing in most cases. Washington is a present-tense city, zero-sum. You can forget almost anything but you shouldn't forget where you're from. Don't you agree?</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, Lucia said.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">They met while Alec was on assignment for the Sunday magazine, portraits to accompany an article on ambassadors—the Iranian, the Brazilian, the Saudi, the Australian, and the Swiss. Ambassadors at home on the weekends, watching American television, playing with their children, examining their stamp collections, building a ship in a bottle, reading Pascal. The Swiss ambassador, not quite understanding what the project was about, was dressed in a dark suit and foulard tie as if headed for his office—which, in fact, he was. Alec was placing his lights and wondering how to persuade his subject to relax when he saw a slender, beautifully built young woman in the doorway, two small children at her side. She was unsuccessfully suppressing laughter at the scene before her, and then she bent down and whispered something to the children, giving them a little push in the direction of their father. Alec took two quick shots of the children hanging on the ambassador's blue serge trousers, his startled expression—as if, Alec remarked later to the photo editor, the brats had demanded passwords to the numbered accounts. Quickly Alec turned back and shot the beauty in the doorway, her arms crossed, her hair falling over her right eye, an expression of the utmost amusement. Three cheers for the ambassador, the old goat; she was much too young for him, a freckle-face who looked to be barely out of college. When she moved away from the doorway Alec saw that she had a slight limp, an imperfection that only increased her allure. He took a dozen correct poses of the ambassador for form's sake. The shot that would make the paper was the one of his small children hanging on his trousers.</p>
<p class="follow">May I have the name of your wife? Alec asked the ambassador when they were alone.</p>
<p class="follow">My wife?</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, in the doorway with the children.</p>
<p class="follow">She is the au pair, the ambassador said curtly. Her name is Lucia Duran.</p>
<p class="follow">How do you spell that? Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">He sent Lucia the photograph of herself in the doorway—it was a fine candid, and he wondered yet again if he were not in the wrong business, his taste ran more to beautiful forms than the grit of the news—and asked if she would have dinner with him. She replied that of course she would and he named a place, a date, and a time. When Alec arrived at the restaurant, a little late, not much, she was seated and drinking a glass of wine. She asked him if he was always late, and he said sometimes he was, not always. Unfortunately his work was governed by deadlines. In that case, she said, why aren't you on time? Because the deadlines keep changing, he said, noticing again the spray of freckles on her cheeks and aware that she was irritated with him. He remembered hearing somewhere that the Swiss had a fetish about punctuality, obsessed as they were by timepieces. The waiter was at his elbow so he ordered a glass of Chianti.</p>
<p class="follow">He said, I made a bit of a mess of things at the embassy with your ambassador. I thought you were his wife.</p>
<p class="follow">She stared at him a long moment. How could I possibly be his wife? His wife is fifty and quite stout.</p>
<p class="follow">Well, I didn't know that. Ambassadors often have wives younger than themselves. Most of the time, in fact. Why—he sought an ambassador from a country she would not know—the Laotian has a wife young enough to be his granddaughter. And I thought that was the situation with the Swiss.</p>

<p class="follow">We have nothing to do with the Laotians, she said. They are in Asia, whereas we are in Europe.</p>
<p class="follow">They are exceptionally randy in Laos. It's the damp tropical weather. Also the Buddhist spirits.</p>
<p class="follow">I don't understand, Lucia said. What means "randy"? But she was smiling when she said it so Alec guessed he had gotten over that hurdle. He was charmed by her accent and the way she sat up straight in her chair as if she had taken lessons in good posture. He complimented her on her dress and the little gold pin she wore. She said the pin had been her mother's, though it was an ordinary gold pin, nothing special. He thought she was blushing but with the freckles it was hard to tell.</p>
<p class="follow">He said, Where did you get the limp?</p>
<p class="follow">She brought her legs under her chair and shrugged off the question.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm sorry, he began.</p>
<p class="follow">Skiing, she said. A bad fall.</p>
<p class="follow">It's hardly noticeable, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">Yet you noticed it, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">They sat in silence a moment and she began to tell him about her work at the embassy, looking after the children, seeing that they took their baths and did their homework. The ambassador and his wife had taken the children to Williamsburg for the weekend. The ambassador wanted to know more about the nation's colonial beginnings and he thought he might find out from the blacksmith's shop and the chandlery. Also, such an experience was educational for the children. She did not get out much herself. She was invited to all the embassy parties—ghastly, boring parties, but it was something to do in the evenings. However, her wages were good and she had a room of her own.</p>
<p class="follow">She asked Alec about his work and he told her, somehow making it sound both more and less interesting than it was. Mostly his assignments were on the Hill, covering committee hearings.</p>
<p class="follow">The Hill?</p>
<p class="follow">Capitol Hill, he said. Congress. Men in front of microphones. You try to get them chewing on the bows of their eyeglasses or taking a drink of water. Pointing a finger at a witness, that's good. And the witness pointing back, even better. It's an unwritten rule that you don't take a picture of them when they fall asleep. Professional courtesy. That's still life. The paper doesn't like still life.</p>
<p class="follow"><em>Nature morte,</em> she said.</p>
<p class="follow">The paper likes action, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">And that's what you like?</p>
<p class="follow">Not particularly. Probably I'm miscast as a newspaper photographer. I'm not much interested in the news. I prefer things in repose.</p>
<p class="follow">You do?</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, he said. Tell me about the accident.</p>
<p class="follow">What accident?</p>
<p class="follow">Your skiing accident.</p>
<p class="follow">I was competing at St. Moritz, leading the trials. And then late in the afternoon I went off on my own, alone as I loved to be, off piste. Where was the harm? A tune-up for the race the next morning. I misjudged a mogul and flew into a tree. Left leg broken below the knee. No more ski competitions for Lucia. I was heartbroken. I thought my life was over. I loved competitive skiing, it meant the world to me. It still does, except now I watch it instead of doing it.</p>
<p class="follow">That's a sad story, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Don't you like competing in the news?</p>
<p class="follow">I never think about it.</p>
<p class="follow">But it must be competitive.</p>
<p class="follow">I suppose it is. But you either get the shot or you don't. I don't think of the news as competitive. It's grass growing on a lawn. Who cares if one blade grows higher than the others, unless of course you care like hell about what a pretty lawn you have.</p>

<p class="follow">Lucia smiled broadly and took a swallow of wine. She said, I was going out for a while with a boy at the State Department. He lived in a house with four other boys. What a place. They acted as if they were still at university. So much filth. An icebox full of beer. It was disgusting. He wanted me to cook for all of them and then he wanted me to sleep with him but I said no thanks and that was the end of that. I think I will go home soon.</p>
<p class="follow">All they talked about was the news, she added.</p>
<p class="follow">How long have you been here? Alec asked.</p>
<p class="follow">Not even a year, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">I hope you don't go home.</p>
<p class="follow">Of course I will go home. But not just yet.</p>
<p class="follow">Good, he said. I'd like you to stay.</p>
<p class="follow">And you? she said. Do you involve yourself with disgusting girls with beer in their iceboxes who offer to sleep with you as a reward?</p>
<p class="follow">Not yet, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">I think this country isn't grown up.</p>
<p class="follow">They were sitting outside on the terrace of the Italian restaurant on New York Avenue, a favorite of young staff assistants on the Hill and journalists. Each table had a candle in a Chianti bottle. The waiters wore white aprons and seemed almost to dance as they moved among the tables, trays of food nicely balanced on the tips of their fingers. The night was balmy, spoiled only marginally by car exhaust from New York Avenue. Conversation was spirited because everyone was talking serious politics, the bill that was stalled in committee, Republican obstructionism, Democratic timidity, cynical newspaper reporters. "Everyone's trying to screw Jack. That's what it's about."</p>
<p class="follow">Their food arrived with two more glasses of wine. Lucia began to talk about Switzerland, hiking in the Engadine in the summer, skiing the rest of the year, a healthy outdoor life except for the foehn, the dangerous summer wind. Washington's climate was not healthy owing to the tropical heat, so damp everything went limp. Thoughts went limp. Thank God the embassy was air-conditioned, but air conditioning was unhealthy also because it was unnatural. As she spoke she moved her head left and right, not looking at Alec but prospecting far away, the Engadine perhaps or some other idealized grown-up non-Washington milieu.</p>
<p class="follow">I am talking too much, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec scarcely understood what she was saying. He heard her voice but listened to it as he would listen to unfamiliar music, gradually gathering the tempo and the melody but baffled nonetheless. He was in a state of enchantment listening to her voice. She had paused and now was talking about friendship, how difficult it was to become close to people. Probably that was her fault. Swiss were reserved. Mountain people were reserved generally. Still, she was alone much of the time.</p>
<p class="follow">He understood that. He thought Lucia's admission startling and now she sat in a glum little zone of silence while voices rose around them. He had the idea that unless he said something equally startling the evening would be ruined. He would never see her again. Alec hardly knew where to begin. He touched her hand.</p>
<p class="follow">I want to tell you something about myself, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">You do?</p>
<p class="follow">I do. Will you listen?</p>
<p class="follow">Of course, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">I just broke up with the girl I've been seeing, Alec said. She's married, her husband is overseas, posted to the American embassy in Moscow. He doesn't want her with him because of the hardship, no amenities, constant surveillance. But he doesn't want to come home either so he's staying on for a second tour because his work is so challenging and important. He's fluent in Russian. He's certain to be promoted very soon and that will mean a larger apartment and a more generous allowance and at that time she can join him and they can have a normal life together. He knows how difficult it is for her, alone in Washington, but things are difficult for him, too, similarly alone and without amenities and under constant surveillance. He works twelve-hour days, seven days a week, because there isn't much else to do in dreary Moscow. His work has become his life and he's working to good effect because of his skill with the Russian language and his affection for the Russian people. He understands the Russians. He believes they are soul mates. The ambassador personally asked him to stay on. In two months he would have leave. How did Italy sound? A holiday in one of the hill towns in Tuscany or farther south, Capri or Rimini, one of the places we've always talked about going to. The trouble was, they had never talked about visiting the hill towns of Tuscany or farther south either. She had no idea where Rimini was located on the landmass of Italy. She was from Minnesota. So was he.</p>
<p class="follow">He told her he was dreaming in Russian. Thinking in Russian.</p>
<p class="follow">He told her that when they had a child, and if the child was a girl, they would name her Nadezhda, meaning hope. If it was a boy, Vladimir, Lenin's nom de guerre.</p>
<p class="follow">She thought he was losing his mind. His mind had disappeared into Russia.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec paused there because he did not know how to put the next part into words that Lucia would understand and sympathize with. She was bent forward, her chin cupped in her hand, staring at him intently, her wine and food forgotten. She was silent while he grappled with his next thought. At the table beside theirs one of the loud young men was saying that the problem in Congress was that bastard Johnson, wouldn't give the president the help and support he needed. It had been a terrible mistake putting Johnson on the ticket, just terrible. Bobby was against it.</p>
<p class="follow">So she took up with me, Alec said. She was lonely. She didn't know Washington well. She said she distrusted it, its glare, its rootlessness, its self-regard. She had no children and few friends. There was no anchor to her life, only her cat and her apartment way out Connecticut Avenue and the grace-and-favor job someone had found for her at one of the foreign policy associations—they call it a think tank. We met at the think tank when I was doing a shoot, Alec said, watching Lucia's mouth edge into a small smile. And we were mightily attracted to each other, although it took us a while to connect because of the distrust she had of Washington, a distrust that specifically included the press, even photographers.</p>
<p class="follow">She told me the story in bits and pieces.</p>
<p class="follow">He bought a little dog and called it Katya or Strelya, a name like that, Russian in origin. The dog kept him company at night. That caused her to wonder how Katya or Strelya would get on with her cat, called Fluffy.</p>
<p class="follow">At any event, the two months came and went and there was no Tuscany or any other part of Italy because of the Cuban missile crisis and its aftermath, when all of us were working our nuts off, as he said, and all leaves were canceled indefinitely. Gosh, I'm so sorry. But this is important. Do you realize we almost went to war? I can tell you that there were some pretty tough moments here at Embassy Moscow and it's only a question of time before they try again. The telephone communications were always bad, lapses and static. They had to shout to make themselves understood. Normal conversation was impossible. Once or twice she heard the dog barking. Alec paused once more.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia said, What was her name?</p>
<p class="follow">Alec said, Olivia. His name was Robert. Robert Sorrensen.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia said, How much of that was true?</p>
<p class="follow">I don't know, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">Did she believe it?</p>
<p class="follow">Some of it. Most of it. She didn't know what to believe. She was suspicious of the hill towns of Tuscany.</p>
<p class="follow">I would be, too, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">And the dreaming in Russian.</p>
<p class="follow">So she took up with you, Lucia said.</p>

<p class="follow">She did. Eventually.</p>
<p class="follow">And was that a happy time for her?</p>
<p class="follow">It was an improvement on what she'd had.</p>
<p class="follow">Was it an improvement on what you'd had?</p>
<p class="follow">It was, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Were you in love with her?</p>
<p class="follow">I would have done anything for her.</p>
<p class="follow">That means you weren't, Lucia said, the words harsher than she intended and so she smiled, making a joke of it.</p>
<p class="follow">Olivia used to tell me wonderful stories about the Iron Range. Her parents were radicals, born in Norway. She couldn't take their politics seriously. They were forever plotting the overthrow of the government in Minneapolis in order to set up a rump state in Ely or Babbitt. Olivia was very close to her parents. Politics to her was a sideshow. That was one other reason we got on so well. What she wanted really was a family of her own, a real house in a real neighborhood, the school down the street. That was the life she wanted.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia was silent a moment, wondering how to frame the next question. She said, Was Olivia in love with you?</p>
<p class="follow">I think she was, Alec said. Not for keeps, though. Not for marriage. We never talked about that.</p>
<p class="follow">A family of her own, a house in a neighborhood. Is that enough?</p>
<p class="follow">It is for many people, quite a number of people, really. Anyhow it's what she wanted.</p>
<p class="follow">But not what you wanted.</p>
<p class="follow">I hadn't given marriage much thought.</p>
<p class="follow">This does not sound like a love match, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Oh, it was. It was in its own way. We had good times together. We looked out for each other. And when all else fails you can't beat lust.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia smiled broadly. What happened then?</p>
<p class="follow">She went back to Minnesota.</p>
<p class="follow">No regrets?</p>
<p class="follow">She didn't like cheating on her husband even though by that time she was certain he was cheating on her. Whether he was or he wasn't, he made it clear that he preferred life in important Moscow rather than life with unimportant her. That seemed to be the end of her dreams of a family, a real home in a real neighborhood, the school down the street, and all the rest. There was something boastful about him now and somewhere in Moscow he had acquired a new accent. When he wasn't dropping Russian words and phrases he was talking about the State De-pot-ment and the ambassa-duh. The transatlantic static on the line concealed much but it couldn't conceal that. That was the way with him, the job and the climb up the ladder. The farther from her the better. Still, he was her husband and she didn't like cheating on him.</p>
<p class="follow">And you. What did you think?</p>
<p class="follow">I didn't like it either. But not enough to stop it.</p>
<p class="follow">That sounds like an honest answer.</p>
<p class="follow">It is an honest answer, Alec said. You see, they were childhood sweethearts, students together at UMinn-Edina. He was a wonderful student. His attention to studies was one of the things she found attractive about him. His ambition was to see the wide world and for a time that was her ambition, too. Ambition was an attractive thing in boys, she said, until suddenly it wasn't. Olivia thought their story was a Washington story and one other reason why she distrusted Washington. Why, he was just a boy from Hibbing. His parents and grandparents were Iron Range people. And now their boy was in Embassy Moscow, a rising star at the State De-pot-ment. Unless that, too, was a fiction.</p>
<p class="follow">Is he still there?</p>
<p class="follow">I don't know. Olivia went back to Edina. I got a postcard from her the other day, a picture of the open pits of the Iron Range. No message. Love, Olivia.</p>
<p class="follow">And the mighty attraction?</p>

<p class="follow">It was a mighty attraction, Alec said. Over now.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia sipped her wine, her eyes fastened on his. That was what you wanted to tell me?</p>
<p class="follow">Not just that. The whole story.</p>
<p class="follow">Didn't you tell me the whole story?</p>
<p class="follow">Ninety-nine percent, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">And that one percent?</p>
<p class="follow">I've forgotten, he said. You always forget one percent.</p>
<p class="follow">She smiled at that and speared a last forkful of lasagna, chewing it without enthusiasm. The restaurant was emptying but not the table next to theirs, embroiled in an argument about the Democratic nominee in 1968, six years hence.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia said, Are you ambitious like Robert?</p>
<p class="follow">No, I'm not ambitious.</p>
<p class="follow">Maybe that's the one percent, she said.</p>
<p class="follow"><em>Oh, horseshit!</em> the loud young man at the nearby table roared and then fell silent, abashed. Diners rising in their chairs sat down again. The restaurant itself came to a sudden halt as if a heavy hand had pulled on its reins. The secretary of defense and two younger men took seats at a table near the hedge that ringed the terrace. At once they began to confer, their heads close together. They gave no indication they knew they were in a public place. They might have been in an office, for instantly documents were produced from a briefcase and each began to read. When a waiter approached he was waved away. The surrounding silence gave way to murmurs of conversation, including the loud young man, much subdued now, commenting only that Lyndon Johnson had about as much chance of being nominated as the man in the moon. It was Bobby's turn. As he spoke his eyes drifted off in the direction of the table near the hedge. At last he shook his head in admiration. He's so brilliant. He's the most brilliant SecDef this country has ever seen. And do you know why? He's in command of the facts, that's why.</p>

<p class="follow">I like making pictures, Alec said. I suppose ambition comes into it somewhere.</p>
<p class="follow">But you don't think about it.</p>
<p class="follow">Not much, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia nodded her head at the table near the hedge. Who is that?</p>
<p class="follow">That is the secretary of defense. A local hero.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec wondered what had brought the secretary of defense to this restaurant, not on anyone's list of highly recommended. What it had was an agreeable terrace, so long as you didn't mind the exhaust fumes from the street. The prices were in line and the waiters were friendly. Alec watched the owner walk to the secretary's table and place a hand on the shoulder of one of the younger men, who rose to his feet to introduce the secretary. So the owner was a friend of the secretary's friend who, from the look of him, was more likely an aide. The owner produced a bottle of wine, opened it, placed menus on the table, and departed. The secretary and the two others continued to read documents. The wine was poured but not tasted.</p>
<p class="follow">I had an affair such as yours, Lucia said. Except he was not married.</p>
<p class="follow">Did it end well?</p>
<p class="follow">He was not a suitable man, she said. He was older. He was fifteen years older than me. I think he was a professional bachelor. That was the way he saw himself and I didn't mind. We had good times together. He was a keen skier. Lucia paused, smiling at the thought, her eyes far away. Beautiful skier, really. It was a pleasure watching him. We often raced and he only beat me once. He didn't like losing, not at all, especially to a girl with a bad leg. Stefan was a competitive personality. Every time he lost he'd go into a funk and I'd think about losing the next time, but I never did except that once.</p>
<p class="follow">Most men are competitive, Alec said.</p>

<p class="follow">But not you, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Not particularly, said Alec. Also, I don't ski.</p>
<p class="follow">I think my affair was very much like your affair with the exception of the marriage.</p>
<p class="follow">A mighty attraction?</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia smiled. Fun, isn't it?</p>
<p class="follow">Assuredly, Alec said. Then, Does it bother you that Olivia was married?</p>
<p class="follow">No. She was lonely. Her husband was far away and inattentive. Probably she thought she had lost him for good. Lucia laughed suddenly, moving her head from side to side. This is a strange conversation for me, she said. We hardly know each other.</p>
<p class="follow">We know each other, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Not so well, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">What did he do? His work.</p>
<p class="follow">Stefan was a banker. Also, he wrote literary articles for one of the Zurich papers. His articles were highly regarded. They were very difficult. Stefan wrote in High German. And then I left for America.</p>
<p class="follow">Because of the literary articles?</p>
<p class="follow">They were not connected, she said. You never ski?</p>
<p class="follow">I never learned.</p>
<p class="follow">I think you would be good at it. You have the body for it. Lucia took another sip of wine, making a face. Since we have come to know each other so well, I do not mind telling you that this wine is filthy.</p>
<p class="follow">As bad as that?</p>
<p class="follow">It tastes like ink, she said. So, she went on, I left Switzerland because I wanted to visit America. I thought I should see it. Stefan was against it. He warned me that America was not anything like Switzerland and that the differences were not agreeable. But I thought that was the reason I should go. Everyone talks about America, what they like about it and what they don't, so I thought I should see for myself. Stefan had never been to America except once, at a conference where no one spoke German. Also, I was a convenience for him and he didn't want to lose the convenience. Someone told me of the ambassador's need for an au pair. So I took the job at the embassy and I have to say that Stefan was not entirely incorrect in what he said. America lacks density. It lacks ... Lucia sought the word and came up with "thrift." Alec listened hard, wondering why the United States should be reduced to a single word or phrase. They would never reduce their own countries to a word. He hoped she would not complain about American innocence. Lucia thought a moment and added, But I am enjoying very much my dinner with you.</p>
<p class="follow">It's thrifty, Alec said. Especially the wine.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia ignored his remark, gesturing instead at the secretary of defense and his aides, still huddled over their documents, not speaking. She said, Are you a part of that?</p>
<p class="follow">No. I only take photographs for the newspaper.</p>
<p class="follow">You're not involved in the other?</p>
<p class="follow">Not really. Alec did not know how far to take this thought. He said, I like the craft of photography, the details you have to pay attention to. The feel of the camera. I'm like the man building a ship in a bottle and at the end of it that's what you have, a ship in a bottle. It's honest work. I don't know that it's anything more than that.</p>
<p class="follow">You made a wonderful shot of me, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">It was good, wasn't it? Five seconds. It took me five seconds.</p>
<p class="follow">What's wrong with that?</p>
<p class="follow">Nothing's wrong with it. Best shot I've made in months. Five seconds.</p>
<p class="follow">I don't understand—</p>
<p class="follow">It was you, Lucia. You were the shot. I just happened to point the camera in the right direction.</p>
<p class="follow">That is foolish, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">Not foolish, Alec said.</p>

<p class="follow">I think you are a utopian, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">She took a sip of wine and looked at the table by the hedge. She said, Your secretary of defense looks tired. He looks as if he could use a good meal and something better than this filthy Chianti. Lucia put her chin in the palm of her hand and continued to scrutinize the secretary of defense. She said, I'm used to it. There was always politics in my mother's house. Politics and books, more books than politics, I think. But they were the same thing. Books were politics, especially novels and poetry. If they didn't have politics they weren't worth reading. My mother said I would marry a political man, a reformer. We would reform the world, this man and I. She was quite sure of that, although I never believed it. She was sure of herself, my mother. She believed in socialism the way religious believe in the church. She thought of the Soviets as the antichrist, corrupting socialism, luring it into a nasty orthodoxy. In the end all the Soviets believed in was themselves. Brutes. My mother called them brutes. Still, she never lost her faith. She had a love affair with socialism. After my father left us she went to bed with socialism. I think she was a utopian. Our apartment was filled with utopians, all of them speaking secondary languages and failing to understand one another when the points were subtle. Also, they were gnomic. They were in love with theory, even my mother. Of course she is gone now, dead three years next month.</p>
<p class="follow">Through the candlelight Alec saw Lucia's eyes fill with tears.</p>
<p class="follow">I miss my mother, she said. Even her socialism.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec nodded without knowing exactly what he was agreeing to. His own political house had to do with campaigns and elections won and lost, legislative programs, the number of congressional districts in Iowa, the supplemental appropriation for the army. Belief didn't come into it since disbelief was unthinkable, along with UFOs and atheism. Alec supposed his father believed in elections. Certainly he believed in the apparatus of American democracy, two political parties, conventions every four years, the Electoral College. Elections certified democracy. In that way democracy was part of the furniture, and if your party lost this year's election you'd get it back next time or the time after. The pie was large, slices enough to go around. Socialism was not on the table, at least the table Senator Malone dined at. Socialism was not an election issue and hadn't been since Joe McCarthy, and socialism to McCarthy was a slogan, the commonist conspiracy, the commonist menace, commonism in the State Department. Joe McCarthy couldn't pronounce the word correctly even when he was sober. Alec tried to imagine his father explaining McCarthy to Lucia's mother—his bogus war record, his mastery of the televised image and the trumped-up charge, and the peculiarities of the state of Wisconsin where all rivers ran north. None of the arguments that had enraptured Europeans for two generations had resonance chez Malone. Alec was tempted to tell Lucia of his own political house but guessed that now was not the time, their meal almost finished but the night with a ways to go. Lucia was silent now, her expression taut. Alec knew she was thinking again of her mother's death. Her still face was lovely in the light of candles.</p>
<p class="follow">Tell me more about your mother.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia shook her head.</p>
<p class="follow">Your house sounds more interesting than mine, Alec said. Was Stefan a political man?</p>
<p class="follow">Oh, no, she said. Not Stefan. Stefan was a banker. His literary articles were a sideline, weekend work. When he was not skiing. He would not have approved of the house I grew up in so I never mentioned it. With us it was a physical thing. He never talked about his banking and I never asked, and I never talked about my mother and he never asked. That was how we got on in the world day to day, more or less. Lucia saw no need to add that Stefan was often rough. She liked his roughness for a while and then she didn't like it. She felt manhandled. She said with a smile, That's enough said. Ours was a Swiss story. Untranslatable.</p>

<p class="follow">Lucia looked closely at Alec, trying to judge his reaction. She wondered if he could read between the lines. Stefan never could. Really, she was judging his sincerity. This Alec was certainly not Stefan, who prized silence above all else. Silence and discretion, she amended. Alec was more attractive than Stefan, she thought, with his pale gray eyes and disarming manner; he knew how to tell a story, too. Alec looked at her straight on whereas Stefan was a personality in profile, a one-eyed jack. When Alec spoke his voice was soft. She did not think he would be rough.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec said, How is it a Swiss story?</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia paused fractionally. It's dense, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">I think I want to go home now, she added.</p>
<p class="follow">All right, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">With you, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">On their way out she gave a little mischievous wave to the secretary of defense, who smiled and waved back. In the car Alec kissed her, their lips barely touching. He took a roundabout route once they were under way, to the Mall and around the Lincoln Memorial, the Capitol behind them. There were pleasure boats on the Potomac, their running lights slithering on the gray surface of the water. The opposite shore was a thin dark line. One very large yacht motored slowly in the direction of National Airport, two smaller boats ahead and two behind like pilot fish. A full moon rose in the eastern sky. Alec wondered aloud if the large yacht was Kennedy's, the <em>Honey Fitz.</em> It was large enough, one hundred feet long at least, displaying only a few running lights. Inside, a rosy glow came from the saloon. Alec turned to Lucia and explained about presidential yachts, a perquisite like Air Force One and Camp David. He thought he saw people on the fantail, guests for the evening cruise. They could be anybody—the shah of Iran, Charles de Gaulle, Che Guevara, the ghost of T. E. Lawrence, or a movie star like Lauren Bacall or David Niven. Who knew who they were? Picasso? John Steinbeck? Maybe even his father if there was something Kennedy wanted badly enough and thought that a night on the <em>Honey Fitz</em> might get it for him. They were drinking and having a fine time on the Potomac. De Gaulle had decided to lecture the shah. Picasso was playing gin rummy with David Niven. George Jessel was telling jokes. A president could call anyone to his table, refusals not accepted. Not that anyone would want to refuse. What would be the point? Alec imagined shooting them wide-angle, focusing on Lucia telling them about her mother's political house, her devotion to socialism, Kennedy listening intently while he smoked a cigar, Che nodding in approval.</p>
<p class="follow">And then they were around the curve and entering sedate Rock Creek Park. Alec was trying to slow things down. He returned to his yacht reverie, speculating to Lucia that even now Kennedy was enjoying a bullshot on the fantail of the <em>Honey Fitz</em> while his secretary of defense was scrutinizing documents and ignoring his meal at the so-so restaurant on New York Avenue. Lucia was laughing, her head nestled into his shoulder, her hand warm against his chest. She murmured something he couldn't hear. Her scent filled the car. He was dizzy with it.</p>
<p class="follow">What did you say?</p>
<p class="follow">Drive faster, she said.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">Five hours later they were still entangled in his bed, windows thrown open to the balmy night. Alec had the idea they were one body. In the darkness he saw an ankle and did not know whose it was. He didn't move, liking the mystery. They had been lying together in silence, not quite dozing but not awake either. He asked her if there was anything she wanted—every phrase was now a double entendre—and she answered yes, she wanted a cup of tea. When he came back with the tea she was sitting up, the sheets gathered around her, staring into an abstract distance. She blew on the tea to cool it, then balanced the cup and saucer on her belly. She began in the middle of her thought, no preamble. She had some sympathy for the husband. What was his name? Robert. She understood Robert, his contrived accent, his excuses, his delusions of importance, his evident weightlessness. She thought probably he was losing himself in Russia. He wouldn't be the first to do so. Even Russians were nervous, Turgenev for example, who seemed to find tranquillity only in France. She understood this because Robert reminded her of herself. Often she felt she was slipping away, losing touch. Her American thoughts were different, looser, without context. Probably she didn't know how to express herself properly. There were times when she felt she could not breathe and yet unlike Robert she was unable to enter fully into American life. She recognized this as fear and believed it common among displaced Europeans. Turgenev became an itinerant, Baden and Paris and provincial France his preferred locations. Always he was drawn back to Russia, though he refused to die there. He would give the motherland his heart but he wouldn't give her his soul. His great subject was the landmass of Russia and how its citizens accommodated themselves or not. At the end he too was weightless. Russia was mightier than he was, a tempest that swept all before it. Lucia spoke slowly. Her voice was drowsy. She said, Turgenev had his idea of Russia as my mother had her idea of socialism.</p>
<p class="follow">But I don't know what I have, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">You have me, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">Right now I feel happy with you, yes.</p>
<p class="follow">My American, she added.</p>
<p class="follow">We have found each other, he said. It's unusual. You had to come all the way from Switzerland.</p>
<p class="follow">To find you, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">And if I hadn't been assigned the shoot at the embassy ... He did not finish the thought. Life did hang by threads, enigma its core. Her arms were around him now. She whispered into his ear.</p>
<p class="follow">He said, I don't want you to lose yourself or slip away.</p>
<p class="follow">It's difficult for me, she said.</p>

<p class="follow">In America there's something for everyone.</p>
<p class="follow">There is?</p>
<p class="follow">Definitely. It's a promise.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm trying, Lucia said.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">Lucia gave notice at the embassy, something that was not done but she was determined to do it. In the event, the ambassador and his wife were understanding. Lucia had been very good with their children and they wished her the best. You and your photographer, the ambassador's wife said. And he is the son of a United States senator! You have done well for yourself, Lucia. He looks to be a fine young man with a promising career. And you seem much happier now than you have been. We were worried about you. America is an unforgiving country. Americans are quick to forget when it suits their purposes. And quick to remember for the same reason.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia moved in with Alec and got a job at the National Zoo. She had always loved animals, bears especially. She was a guide for groups of foreign tourists owing to her fluency in French and German. After hours she helped with the cages. Lucia found the zoo workers entertaining, many of them young and at loose ends; they constituted a kind of family, animals included. In due course she met Alec's parents and found them welcoming. Alec's mother was a chain smoker and in that, if in no other way, she reminded Lucia of her own mother. The senator was more reserved. He reminded her of a music teacher she'd had in Zurich, a better talker than he was a musician or a teacher. Senator Malone spoke in a heavy baritone that rose and fell as if he were reading from a script. Alec called it his toga-talk. The senator did not treat his son with respect so her relations with him were guarded. He invited her to call him Kim, but she could not bring herself to do it so continued to address him as Senator. When they told his parents that they planned to marry, Alec's mother was delighted and full of ideas, the wedding to be held at the Episcopal church in Chevy Chase, the reception at one of the downtown clubs. A champagne reception with an orchestra, toasts to fini sh things off. The chaplain of the Senate can do the honors.</p>
<p class="follow">Would you like that, dear?</p>
<p class="follow">We have other plans, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Let Lucia speak for herself, Alec. It's her wedding. It's the bride who decides. It's her day. But we are so happy you decided to have the wedding here as opposed to Switzerland, so far away.</p>
<p class="follow">We'd planned to elope, Lucia said hesitantly.</p>
<p class="follow">Elkton, Maryland, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec's mother lit a contemplative cigarette, her lipstick bright against the white paper. We could have such a nice wedding reception at the club, all our friends, all your friends, a day to remember always.</p>
<p class="follow">The Johnsons will come, the senator said. Maybe even the president. Jackie, too.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia looked at him, startled. They will?</p>
<p class="follow">Of course they will, the senator said. Jack and I go way back. We've known the Johnsons for many, many years. Last year we were at the ranch. The senator went on to speak of other Washington personalities, men and their wives. Lucia did not recognize the names but understood they were important. The names flew past. Humphrey. Dirksen. Udall. Acheson. Krock. She had the picture of a theatrical troupe, introduced and then hustled offstage. Lucia was tongue-tied. She did not know what to think; the idea of the vice president at her wedding, perhaps even proposing a toast, asking her to dance, was alarming. The president and Jackie likewise was unthinkable. She wondered what her mother would say. Surely she would approve of the president, who with his charm and mordant humor was seen almost as an honorary European. But her mother would be suspicious all the same, of Kennedy's robber baron father and the vice president's oil connections. The vice president had once shown up at a reception at the embassy, moving briskly around the room, the ambassador at his side; and then he was gone, vanished through the double doors, one of his assistants explaining that he was obliged to return to the White House for a meeting with the president. The ambassador did not believe him. He had done his duty and now wanted to go home or to his office on the Hill, drink a double Scotch, make some calls. Lucia felt her chest tighten and for a moment she thought she would faint. She turned to Alec and was unsettled to see his stony expression.</p>
<p class="follow">We've made our plans, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Let Lucia have her say, the senator said.</p>
<p class="follow">I want what Alec wants, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">They were standing in the living room of the Malone house in Chevy Chase, cocktail time. Alec and his father and mother were drinking highballs, Lucia a glass of champagne. Alec had brought a bottle for the occasion. The room was brightly lit and filled with photographs of Washington personalities, some of the most recent shot by Alec. Many of the photographs were quite old. Lucia's mother's study was similarly decorated—perhaps decorated was not the exact word for it, more a statement of principles. Her photographs were grainy and formal. The subjects wore hats. Turgenev, Adorno, James Joyce, Walter Benjamin, and a lithograph of Robespierre. Lucia looked at the Malone collection and wondered if any of them were of Swiss ancestry. Doubtless not. The Swiss did not figure in the American experience. In that way, the Washington personalities were no different from Turgenev, Adorno, James Joyce, Walter Benjamin, and Robespierre. Where was the Swiss imprint on the world? But it was the simple truth that the Swiss had never been colonizers. They were content in their mountain fortress, occasionally venturing abroad when business required it. All the men in the Malone photographs looked well fed and wore blue suits, except for one very well fed adventurer who was dressed in riding boots, jodhpurs, and floppy hat, an exceptionally toothy grin below a bushy mustache, robust to the point of caricature.</p>

<p class="follow">A reception would mean so much to your mother, the senator said to Alec. And to me, too. I have an idea! Perhaps a smaller affair, the wedding and reception right here in this living room. I can get the chaplain of the Senate—</p>
<p class="follow">That should be Lucia's choice, Kim. Alec's mother looked anxiously at her daughter-in-law-to-be. She did not know her well and they had never had a private conversation. Lucia appeared pale, her eyes downcast. She had fini shed one glass of champagne, Alec had poured her another, and now that was gone. Mag thought they had pushed Lucia too hard. The poor girl was out of her depth, totally dependent on Alec. She hoped her son knew what he was doing but had no great confidence on that score. Alec had always gone his own way, bullheaded like his father. His bullheadedness sat side by side with an alarming indifference to the world around him, as if what happened there was no concern of his. He did not seem connected to anything, not his work, not his country; perhaps this girl, now on her third glass of champagne, was the solution. Also, Alec had not a clue as to what his wedding day meant to his father and mother. An only child was always a burden.</p>
<p class="follow">The senator said, Whoever does the service, we could still have a restricted reception of twenty people, perhaps a few more.</p>
<p class="follow">Too many hurt feelings, Mag said sharply. It's the best way in the world to make enemies, especially in Washington.</p>
<p class="follow">You have a point there, the senator said.</p>
<p class="follow">The Johnsons, for example.</p>
<p class="follow">But they would head the list!</p>
<p class="follow">And the Dirksens and the Humphreys. What about them?</p>
<p class="follow">The senator fell silent and Lucia had a sudden sense of futility, a vertigo. She was unable to see the way ahead. Her list would have included only a few names: the ambassador and his wife; and Andrea and Jeanette, au pair girls she saw often in the park; two or three others from the zoo. The bear girl and her husband. Lucia had friends in Switzerland but she had been out of touch with them and they could not afford a trip to America in any case. Lucia had thought of herself and Alec as a nation of two, subject to their own laws and customs, but now she wasn't so sure. Alec's parents had their own claim. She realized that she would be surrounded by strangers at her own wedding if the Malones had their way. The thought of being introduced to people she did not know at such an intimate occasion appalled her. She would not know what to say—and then she imagined her father arriving, risen from the dead wearing his Borsalino and smoking a cigarette, introduced to the vice president and all the other notables, astonished that his daughter moved in such elevated circles. He was not himself disconcerted, appearing perfectly at ease in a fine suit and polished shoes. Yet it was apparent from his looks and his manner that he was an outdoor man among indoor men. Women were drawn to him and it was a moment before he and Lucia embraced. Hello, Papa. Hello, Lucia, you look lovely today. Where have you been, Papa? I have been away, he said, living in Czechoslovakia. I live in the country, a beautiful house on a mountaintop ... Lucia's thought vanished there and she was back in the Malones' living room.</p>
<p class="follow">When are you going to have this elopement? the senator asked. I'm going to have to get out a news release. They'll be interested back home.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia looked at Alec, but he only smiled, and took her hand. He said to his father, Next week.</p>
<p class="follow">And then what?</p>
<p class="follow">Ten days on the Eastern Shore, Chestertown. I've rented a sailboat.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia looked at him again. This was the first she had heard about a sailboat.</p>
<p class="follow">We'll go cruising, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">You seem to have thought of everything, the senator said.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec has been wonderful, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">And where will you live?</p>

<p class="follow">We've bought a place in Georgetown, Alec said. Small. But it has a back yard with a rose garden. You'll love it when you see it. He turned to his mother and added, It's just down the street from Mrs. Wheatley's.</p>
<p class="follow">A pretty house, Lucia said. Wonderful shade trees all around. The street reminds me of a street I knew well in Zurich.</p>
<p class="follow">That's nice, dear. I myself have never been to Zurich.</p>
<p class="follow">We'd like to be at the wedding, the senator said.</p>
<p class="follow">It's all arranged, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Does that mean yes or no? the senator asked.</p>
<p class="follow">I know you will be very happy, Alec's mother said.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">That evening, out of Alec's hearing, Margaret Malone invited Lucia for tea, just the two of them, so that they might come to know each other better. Friday afternoon, she said, and when Lucia responded that she was working at the zoo until four, Mrs. Malone said that was perfectly all right. Come when you can, come as you are. They sat on the screened-in porch facing a wide lawn with shade trees; the sprinklers were working because of the dry spell. The family cat was asleep in the big wing chair—Kim's chair, Alec's mother explained, but the cat appropriated it when the senator was absent. Did you have cats when you were a child?</p>
<p class="follow">Dogs, Lucia said. Spaniels.</p>
<p class="follow">This cat is sixteen years old.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec and I have never discussed pets, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Pets are not at the top of Alec's list.</p>
<p class="follow">They're not?</p>
<p class="follow">Not in my hearing, Mrs. Malone said, smiling briefly, pouring tea and offering the accessories, sugar, milk, lemon slices, little cakes on a flowered plate. She lit a cigarette and looked hopefully at her daughter-in-law-to-be.</p>
<p class="follow">Mrs. Malone, Lucia began.</p>
<p class="follow">Call me Mag, please. Everyone does.</p>

<p class="follow">I know you're disappointed about our wedding plans. Lucia paused, gathering her thoughts. She said, Alec wants something for us alone, only us, for us to remember. I have no family so of course I agree with him. Whatever he wants, I want. I think he does not want a commotion.</p>
<p class="follow">Commotion, Mag said.</p>
<p class="follow">Too many people, Lucia said. Then it becomes something for them and not for us.</p>
<p class="follow">But—his father and me?</p>
<p class="follow">And the others, Lucia said, believing already that she had said both too much and not enough and was putting the case badly. She wished she could have spoken in French, the language of diplomacy. Even German. Mag Malone was tapping her cigarette on the edge of a glass ashtray. She looked out the window when the sprinklers abruptly ceased but her exasperated expression did not go away. Lucia said, The Johnsons and the ... others. She could not remember the names of the senators and statesmen they knew so well, so well they were like family and would be insulted if they were left off the guest list.</p>
<p class="follow">But if your parents were alive—</p>
<p class="follow">They aren't, Lucia said. They are both gone.</p>
<p class="follow">—you would want them there.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia shrugged, a slight movement of her shoulders. The subject was impossible.</p>
<p class="follow">I see, Mag said. She had never met a girl so literal and wondered if that was a specific trait of the Swiss, like French cynicism or German anxiety. Lucia was a wonderful-looking girl and appeared devoted to Alec but there was something elusive about her, a strange trait in one so literal. Mag did not know how far to go with this Swiss, soon to be a member of her family, the mother of her grandchildren. She wanted grandchildren more than anything. All her friends had grandchildren. She did not want to make an enemy of her daughter-in-law-to-be, but Mag had always been direct and saw no reason not to be direct now.</p>

<p class="follow">Mag said, It's hard for me to admit that I never understood Alec, even as a little boy. I never understood what made him tick and I still don't. But that isn't the point actually. The point is that he never understood us, his father and me. I am bound to say that he didn't make much effort. He never asked us the usual questions—how did you meet, where did you go on dates, how did you know you were right for each other, and if there were doubts, what were they? I think Alec made his own world but what that world is I cannot say. I don't know if he has a destination. I think he has an ad hoc sort of life, but of course I may be mistaken. His father and I live in a public world, not every hour of every day but often enough, and it's a glass house, too, not always but sometimes. Not to everyone's taste, glass houses. I imagine it can be difficult for a child, a father in the public eye. But politics is Kim's life and it is my life also, has been from the beginning. What you would call the rhythm of our life is governed by election cycles and by whatever important matter is before the Senate. There's always something, on the floor or in one of Kim's committees. That's public business. I can hardly remember the time when our life was not public. Alec has never understood or if he has understood he has never appreciated that his father does serious work, essential work, the people's business. He is frequently away and so am I. Our dinner hour is interrupted. Weekends, too. Our schedule fits into the political calendar, not the other way around. In that sense our time is not our own and that's the bargain you make. I should say the bargain you choose because no one forces you. No one holds a gun to your head. Kim doesn't regret it and I don't either except we seem to be estranged from our only son. We have friends who are in the same boat. We all knew there would be a price for the life we chose. We none of us thought the price would be our children's affection.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia waited for Mag to say more but evidently she had said all she was going to.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia said, Things look different to a child than to a parent.</p>

<p class="follow">Yes, they do. And unfortunately they are the ones who must adapt.</p>
<p class="follow">And if they don't?</p>
<p class="follow">They will be disappointed.</p>
<p class="follow">I don't think Alec is disappointed.</p>
<p class="follow">I hope not, Mag said.</p>
<p class="follow">Definitely, Lucia replied.</p>
<p class="follow">Have you spoken to him of this—estrangement?</p>
<p class="follow">Never, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec hasn't brought it up?</p>
<p class="follow">No. Not once.</p>
<p class="follow">Mag took a cigarette from the box on the table but did not light it. She said, Kim thinks the sun rises and sets by Alec. He wanted very much for Alec to follow him into politics. It was not a stupid dynasty thing. Kim thinks of public service as an honorable way to spend your time, making a life of the public's business. Politics can get nasty. Your hands get dirty. You lose things you thought you could never lose. You compromise again and again. Kim did things he wasn't proud of and I wasn't proud of, either. But we got through it. And the business got done. And every six years you go back home to see if the public has approved. And if they have not, you're out the door. Kim thought Alec had the temperament for politics but Kim was wrong. If I were a sentimentalist I would say Kim's heart was broken. But it wasn't broken, only hardened. I hope you and Alec have many children and that they bring you great joy. Mag moved her cigarette back and forth in her fingers, her expression drawn. Then she asked Lucia if she had been close to her mother.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, Lucia said, I was.</p>
<p class="follow">Did she work?</p>
<p class="follow">She taught European history.</p>
<p class="follow">And your father?</p>
<p class="follow">I barely knew him, Lucia said. He went away one day and did not come back.</p>

<p class="follow">I'm sorry, Lucia.</p>
<p class="follow">He is <em>disparu,</em> Lucia said, using the French word without realizing she had.</p>
<p class="follow">What did he do, dear?</p>
<p class="follow">My father?</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, his business.</p>
<p class="follow">He—And Lucia paused there. Her mother had never spoken of her father's work. She said he was a political man, that they were political together. Lucia said, He was killed in the war. The Germans killed him.</p>
<p class="follow">Mag nodded slowly and lit her cigarette. She stared through the screen to the lawn, darkening now at dusk. The grass was still damp from the sprinklers. She remembered the day years ago when they bought the house, fearing that the price was beyond their means. Her mother lent them money for the down payment, an embarrassment for Kim. He didn't want to take it but Mag insisted, forcing his hand. She wanted the house. She wanted to begin life in Washington on a correct footing. She was pregnant and wanted a decent bedroom for the baby and room for the other babies that were sure to follow, and those were arguments that Kim could not challenge. They both understood they would be in Washington for many years. Now Alec had gone and bought a house without telling them, not that he needed permission but simply to share the news. Eleanora Wheatley, daughter of a suffragette and a merchant prince, had a word for men like Alec. She called them egoists.</p>
<p class="follow">Mag said, I mentioned a moment ago that Alec had made his own world and that I didn't know what that world was. Well, we all make our own worlds and those worlds tend to be mysterious to outsiders. Even a spouse sometimes, if she is unlucky. I do fear that Alec is forever searching for the thing that is just beyond his reach. But the point is, Lucia, I don't know what my son believes in and I wonder if he does.</p>
