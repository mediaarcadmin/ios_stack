<h1 class="chaptertitle">THE THICK OF IT</h1>
<p class="left"><b>A</b><span style="font-size: smaller">LEC WENT TO BED TROUBLED</span>. Before sleep came he was reading the African book of the great Polish correspondent Ryszard Kapuscinski, his observation that ordinary people searched for normality. The search was instinctive. In Africa the brutality of political events—coup d'état, rampage, revolution, conflict of every color and shape—was seen as a function of nature, natural phenomena to be endured and waited out as one would endure and wait out a storm from the heavens. In time the storm passed and normal life resumed, even if that normal life consisted of nothing more than sitting in the sun or enjoying a morning cup of coffee. Such people had no interest in pushing the envelope of human experience. Envelope-pushing was not in their nature. Envelope-pushing got you into a world of trouble, perhaps dead. Envelope-pushing was another word for vanity. But Alec was not certain that the slow-moving sundrenched furnace of central Africa was applicable in the century of the American empire, where war was always waged in a distant country and affectless unless you knew someone who was there, a soldier or civil servant. Otherwise it was experienced as a photograph in the newspaper or a film on television or on the Internet. A good question for Kapuscinski, but Kapuscinski was dead and unavailable for questioning. They said that wherever Kapuscinski went in the world, and he went most everywhere, his true subject was Poland. Iran, Congo, China—only Poland written in another tongue. Alec had no idea whether what they said was true. It sounded true, and if it was, then Poland was a fabulous country.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec showered and dressed and drank two cups of coffee while he scanned page one of the newspaper—more of the same, with a well-balanced photograph of an Iraqi child perched on the knee of a GI, stock footage except the child was smoking a cigarette, as world-weary as any café intellectual. Alec looked at the weather report, cloudy with rain later in the day. When he looked at the date he gave a start. Today was his father's birthday, an occasion that meant a great deal to the old man. Last year Alec had bought him a bottle of single-malt Scotch with an unpronounceable name, and when he died there was still a half-inch in the bottle. Alec stared at the date for a long time, then went to his desk and wrote a note to Mathilde, telling her where he was going and when he intended to return. Then he set out for the cemetery, the Leica snug in his pocket, strolling up the street past Admiral Honeycutt's old house and Ronald diAntonio's until he came to Mrs. Wheatley's, all the shades drawn and a faded white carnation in the gutter. The morning newspapers were stacked neatly on the front stoop. His mother had told him once that Eleanora Wheatley read six newspapers a day, cover to cover except for the sports page. She enjoyed catching her guests in errors of fact, Joseph Alsop a favorite target, Kim Malone not far behind. He wondered if Ryszard Kapuscinski had ever visited America. Certainly he had, everyone came to America sooner or later. But had he ever written on the subject? Probably not. America was not Kapuscinski's material, since it bore no conspicuous resemblance to Poland.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec entered the cemetery grounds at R Street and took the path that wound down in the direction of Rock Creek Park, past gravestones high and low, plain and gaudy, old stones side by side with new ones. At nine in the morning the cemetery was deserted, and then he noticed a woman setting up her easel near the Saint-Gaudens monument to Clover Adams, Henry's wife, who died in circumstances mostly unaccounted for, except it was known she drank from her own darkroom's developing chemicals; toward the end of her life she had become a passionate photographer. And decades later Eleanor Roosevelt came to sit by the hour beside Clover Adams's grave after she learned of her husband's affair with Lucy Mercer. Alec's father had told him the story. He called the gravesite hallowed ground.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec walked awhile, uncertain where he was in the cemetery. He was slightly winded moving down the undulating path. The distant parkway was thick with rush-hour traffic, carbon monoxide heavy in the chilly air, now and again the sound of an auto horn. He remembered the Reverend Willis walking uphill and pausing beside a tree, and now he tried to locate the tree. His father's grave was on the downslope not far from the parkway. Alec rested a moment on one of the benches placed at intervals along the path. Traffic was at a standstill now and he heard programs from a score of radios, Snoop Dogg and Puccini and news talk joined in a mighty cacophony, two hos and Rodolfo making their way arm in arm along the dangerous streets of Baghdad. Alec closed his eyes and when he opened them he saw his father's grave not fifty feet away. He sat very still, the Leica inert in his hand. A fat black crow was poking at the grave soil, its head jerking violently.</p>
<p class="follow">There were no known photographs of Mrs. Roosevelt at the grave of Clover Adams.</p>
<p class="follow">Those days, his father said, they let people alone.</p>

<p class="follow">Alec stood and sidestepped down the slope. The bird flew away. He picked his way down, sliding here and there on the damp grass. The Leica was still in his hand but he had forgotten about it. Standing at the graveside he tried to summon his father's presence but was unsuccessful. He had thought of a few words to say, so he said them without confidence that they would be heard by anyone except himself. He asked for repose of his father's soul and happiness in the afterlife. He wished him happy birthday and hoped that someone had remembered to bring a cake and a bottle of Scotch. No one should have to celebrate alone. Alec stepped back then and squeezed off two shots of the grave and the wilting flowers beside it. They would be flat shots, for there were no shadows on this milky spring morning. The grave soil was cold to his touch and damp but he picked up a fistful anyway, crumbling it in his fingers. Alec stood stone still, aware of the stalled traffic behind him. What a lonely figure he must look to the commuters on the parkway and the joggers on the path next to it. He stepped back two more paces and put the camera in his pocket. Upslope he saw the gravediggers, the same two who had attended his father. One of them pushed the wheelbarrow and the other strolled alongside. They were talking companionably and when they saw Alec they gave respectful salutes and Alec saluted back. He thought suddenly that gravedigging must be the oldest profession. He watched them continue on their way over the hill for the day's work. Alec made a last shot of them as they disappeared over the brow.</p>
<p class="follow">He had done what he came to do and now it was time to go back home, visit with Mathilde. Yet Alec did not move. He listened for his father's words but heard nothing except the sound of traffic. He tried to summon conversations from years past but was not successful. His father was lodged in a region of his mind but that region was not accessible. He could not at that moment even recall the sound of the old man's voice, its tone and timbre. Alec bent down, knees creaking, and made another shot. He thought of the urn under the earth and the ashes inside the urn. Something paltry and incomplete about it, not equal to the occasion—and Alec thought then that he was feeling not grief but loss, unless they were the same thing. He and the old man were fundamentally estranged, had been estranged for decades, a question of temperament, differing ideas on how a life might be usefully lived. What counted, and the reckoning. They saw the world through opposing lenses. He wondered if the same schism occurred between mothers and daughters, and then he remembered Lucia and her mother, married to socialism. In his father's life there seemed no separation between the public and the private, each locked in death's grip. Alec wondered if his father saw his son's life as a rebuke. Probably he did. Ryszard Kapuscinski's father must have felt the same rejection. What was his boy doing flinging himself all over the world, the Asian continent, Africa, the Middle East. What was wrong with Poland? Except the whole world was Poland, and when he died Kapuscinski was the most admired foreign correspondent in all Europe. His father would have known that and, dime to a dollar, would have been proud. Surely that was the case.</p>
<p class="follow">Time to go. But Alec did not move.</p>
<p class="follow">The old man had led a satisfactory life, a life of consequence to a very great age where he could look back with satisfaction and some wonder and amusement. The Senate was no doubt a better place with him than without him. He had been on the right side of things generally, moments of accomplishment and some courage along with low comedy and the usual disappointments and compromises and feuds, the blowback of a political life. Kim Malone liked being in the thick of it. He often said there was no reason to live in Washington if you were not in the thick of it. If you didn't want the thick of it, go back to Dubuque. Alec remembered Timmy James chain-smoking and threatening to piss on a Republican. The evening calls from Franklin Roosevelt, his high Hudson Valley squire's accent instantly recognizable, wanting help with this or that piece of legislation or a judge or cabinet member he wanted confirmed at once without delay. Can you help me with this? Calls every night from colleagues and lobbyists, constituents, now and again a vice president, but the call that counted was the one from the White House. None was savored in the way that the Hudson Valley squire's calls were savored. Kim Malone believed himself indispensable to the civic life of the nation. Nothing else mattered in quite the same way as a war resolution, a tax act, Social Security, Lend-Lease. Ordinary life was a version of frivolity, redundant, and in that way he and Andre Duran were kin, one holding a floor and the other a sword. Against that Alec had a camera, used for peaceful purposes. Against that was the thought that life was not a competitive race. In life, as in golf, you played against the course, not your opponent. Courses came in infinite varieties of shapes and sizes and degrees of difficulty. Success depended on the shots you had and how creative you were with them, and always a requiem at the end of the day. Alec supposed he could be described as having had a sidelines sort of life, peaceable for the most part. Wasn't it Orwell who observed that pacifism was a respectable idea so long as you were willing to accept the consequences?</p>
<p class="follow">He heard a step behind him and wheeled about to see Mathilde.</p>
<p class="follow">She said, I knew you would be here.</p>
<p class="follow">To say a few last words, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">I have to say goodbye, Papa. I have a noon flight.</p>
<p class="follow">So soon? Well, I'm glad you were here.</p>
<p class="follow">Me too.</p>
<p class="follow">When will I see you next?</p>
<p class="follow">Mathilde gave an inconclusive shrug. Probably a few months. Certainly before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="follow">You should make an effort to meet Andre. You'd like him. He's—unusual.</p>

<p class="follow">Mama said the reunion went well. She was nervous beforehand.</p>
<p class="follow">I think it did, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">She's with him now, Mathilde said.</p>
<p class="follow">The reunion meant quite a lot to Andre, too.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm worried about you, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">Don't be, Alec said. He raised the Leica to his left eye and made two shots of his daughter. For the second shot Mathilde offered a wide grin—a reluctant grin, Alec thought. He said, I'm driving up to Maine for a week or two. I'll call you in London.</p>
<p class="follow">Will you take care of yourself? You should get more exercise. And watch your diet. Mathilde went on in that vein and when she finished they embraced, and with a wave she was gone, walking back up the hill with an athletic stride. Alec waited a few moments before he, too, began the climb up the hill.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">Home, Alec stepped into the kitchen and brewed a pot of coffee. He was winded from the walk back from the cemetery and now paused to take stock of his surroundings. The pot was decades old. The refrigerator and stove were decades old, as were the chairs and sofa in the living room. The carpet was threadbare. The digital wall clock was new, a Christmas gift from Mathilde. He could donate the ensemble to the Smithsonian for one of their exhibits, "The Way We Lived Then." Minus the wall clock. Minus the Bose radio, also a gift from Mathilde. Probably the time had come to give the place a shave and a haircut, a makeover for the twenty-first century. Alec made a mental note to call Bloomingdale's in the morning. Bloomingdale's was his mother's department store of choice. Two chairs and a sofa—his mother had called it a davenport—and new end tables, and lamps to go with the end tables. He heard a sound somewhere and thought it was his father laughing.</p>
<p class="follow">Pouring coffee, he remembered the telephone call from the night before, the one he had left for the answering machine. He touched the button and heard Annalise's breathy voice. She was arriving in New York at four in the afternoon, staying at the Algonquin. I've been thinking about you and hope everything went well with your father. Are you going to Maine? Please call.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec drank his coffee, killing time for an hour, paying bills and thinking about Bloomingdale's. A dozen or more bills had collected over the past fortnight. He made a mental note to call his bank for a fresh supply of checks. He noticed another ten percent increase in his health insurance premium. Heating oil was on the rise. The American Express bill was negligible because he hadn't been anywhere. The Democratic Party needed money. Alec put the mail aside and called the Algonquin and left a welcoming message for Annalise. At noon he set off in his car, up Wisconsin Avenue to Military Road, right on Military to the tree-lined street where Goya House was located. He sat in his car a moment listening to the engine tick. Andre was alone on the porch, looking as if he had not moved since the previous evening. He was smoking a cigarette and rocking gently in his chair and did not notice Alec approach.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre? Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes. Andre fumbled with his earpiece.</p>
<p class="follow">It's Alec, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia is no longer here. She had to catch her airplane.</p>
<p class="follow">I know.</p>
<p class="follow">She is returning to Europe, Andre said. She did not bring Mathilde. Apparently there were appointments at the State Department.</p>
<p class="follow">Mathilde left for London this morning. Via New York.</p>
<p class="follow">So much travel in your family. But we'll meet when it is time.</p>
<p class="follow">I wanted to see you again.</p>
<p class="follow">Why?</p>
<p class="follow">I enjoyed our conversation yesterday.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre made a sound somewhere between a laugh and a grunt and in a sudden motion pitched his cigarette onto the lawn. The day had turned dark, heavy clouds building to the west, no breeze.</p>
<p class="follow">Your story interests me. I would like to know more. You see, I have never met anyone like you. With your background. The way you have lived your life.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre shrugged and shook his head.</p>
<p class="follow">I don't mean to intrude, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Would you like Turkish coffee? Without waiting for a reply, Andre rapped sharply on the window and called for the boy to bring the pot and two cups right away. The answering shout was grudging.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec's Leica was in his pocket. He said, Would you mind if I took your photograph?</p>
<p class="follow">No photographs, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">As you wish.</p>
<p class="follow">Why do you want to know how I came to be at Goya House? It is no business of yours. Lucia said you were curious.</p>
<p class="follow">I am curious about Goya House.</p>
<p class="follow">It's an ordinary boarding house, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">Of exiles, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, of exiles.</p>
<p class="follow">Not ordinary, surely.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre sighed and did not speak for a full minute. Rain began to fall softly, more heard than seen. Leaves on the trees shivered with it, the sky lowering. Nothing moved in the street. At last Andre said, The historian Holder arranged it. He was very ill but he made the necessary calls. Goya House has a board of directors and one of them is a newspaper editor. Holder called the editor, who made the necessary inquiries. Quite simple, really. There is a Goya House in the suburbs of Paris and another near Toulouse and a villa in Italy. Mostly for the casualties of fascism but not only fascism. This house had a vacancy and I filled the vacancy. End of story.</p>
<p class="follow">I see, Alec said.</p>

<p class="follow">There's nothing underhanded about it, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">I didn't think there was.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, you did.</p>
<p class="follow">I was only curious, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre was silent again, smiling to himself, watching rain leak through the trees. He said, We had a death last month, an old comrade. We had met briefly in Spain in 1938, the Catalonian front. We were on—I cannot say opposite sides but sides that were distrustful of each other, most suspicious. A feature of the Spanish war, a matter of control of tactics and strategy. Who has possession of the genie in the bottle. He was an anarchist and I was on the communist side, of course. It is the nature of anarchists to cause trouble. Anarchy is their way. <em>Que lastima,</em> as the Spanish say. What a pity. He was still full of fight, that one, and he was even older than I am. Hated us, hated the priests, hated the fascists, and at the end of his life hated the king most of all. He mourned Catalonia his entire life. He insisted there be no funeral. No formal notice of his death. He did not want to give them satisfaction. He only wanted his ashes returned to Catalonia and scattered in his native village near Gerona. He was a man of the mountains. He left us money for airfare, though he hated doing it. He hated money. Money was the antichrist even more than the priests. So we have this money and now we have to decide who is going to Catalonia with Salvador's ashes.</p>
<p class="follow">Not you, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Not me. I will spend the rest of my days here, however many days remain to me. Someone will volunteer. We try to look after one another. We are a community after all. We have responsibilities, even toward someone as disagreeable as Salvador.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre rapped the glass again. Where is the little shit?</p>
<p class="follow">I have a question for you about Mathilde, he went on. Is she one of those responsible for your interventions here, there, and everywhere.</p>

<p class="follow">No, Alec said with a smile. I think those decisions are taken at a level higher than hers. The president, the secretary of state. God. God apparently has a role in the administration's statecraft.</p>
<p class="follow">She has no part in them?</p>
<p class="follow">She is one of those who carry them out, the decisions.</p>
<p class="follow">An apparatchik, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">A Foreign Service officer, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Isn't it strange? Time was, America refused to intervene anywhere. Spain, Czechoslovakia, Poland. Now it intervenes everywhere. Asia, Central America, the Middle East, even Africa. No corner of the globe is immune. Do you have an explanation? I mean other than God's hand.</p>
<p class="follow">You could say we learned our lesson.</p>
<p class="follow">Is that what you would say?</p>
<p class="follow">No, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">One of our group here is Polish. He, too, was in Spain, though we did not know each other. He fought the Nazis and then the Soviets and ended up in the Gulag. In due course he was released, drifted for a time, and ended up here. He has a nephew who lives near Krakow. The nephew calls himself a squatter. He does not work but somehow he gets along. He is forty years old, this nephew. He says he writes poetry but refuses to show his poems to his uncle. My Polish friend does not know what to make of his nephew, who seems to have made nothing of his life. He has a wife but they have no children. He lives day to day with his poetry, which he does not publish. Well, who is to say? Kafka published almost nothing in his lifetime. But my friend does not think his nephew is Kafka. Lately his letters have taken a fresh turn. He has identified his enemies. They are, along with the Americans and the Russians, the state, the church, the gangsters, the drug dealers, the skinheads, and the police. They are destroying Poland. Destroying him. This is the thrashing-about of the powerless. People who have no investment in anything. Their morale breaks. They turn their scorn on anyone and anything outside. Never themselves. They lose their ability to think critically. Therefore they cannot make a life for themselves.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre paused and added, I do not know why I tell you this story. But it was what I was thinking about when you arrived.</p>
<p class="follow">Then the front door slammed and the boy was at their elbows with the tray of coffee cups and the spouted pot. He said something to Andre, who grunted noncommittally. The boy departed at once and Andre poured, the coffee thick as lava. They sat quietly waiting for the coffee to cool. From somewhere in the house Alec heard Russian music, a balalaika.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec said, Do you miss soldiering?</p>
<p class="follow">Andre said, Of course. Soldiering was something I did well. Did very well. I was often beside myself with fright. But my fright did not prevent me from acting. Only once or twice was I frozen in place, unable to move forward. This is not a good feeling. Breathing is difficult. Yet it goes away. I am too old for soldiering now so it is just as well that I spend my days here on this porch, drinking my coffee during the day and schnapps in the evening, thinking about the nephews of friends and anything else that occurs to me. I sleep well at night. And you. Do you miss photography?</p>
<p class="follow">I still photograph. Mostly for my own pleasure. Now and again I take a job if the job interests me. But the jobs that come along interest me less and less, so I find myself marking time more than I would like. Until very recently I was caring for my father but he is gone now.</p>
<p class="follow">You did not marry again after Lucia left you?</p>
<p class="follow">No. Once was enough.</p>
<p class="follow">Nor I after I left Lucia's mother. It has to be said that I did not have many chances. Spain, then France with the Resistance, later on in Czecho and Yugoslavia. Then the camps. After the camps I was not romantically inclined. I had opportunities for mercenary work in Africa but that did not interest me. I had no interest in Africa. There was nothing in Africa worth fighting for except money. I knew a few women when I was working at the ski resort but they were only tourists and not interested in anything permanent, and I suppose in that way the liaisons suited us both. I did not have the sort of background that lent itself to sharing. Isn't that the word in use now? Sharing? I hear it on television. One time I told a woman about my early life and when I woke up in the morning she was gone, not even a note left behind. And we were fond of each other. I think I frightened her. I know I did, Andre concluded, and gave a shrug.</p>
<p class="follow">It's the opposite with me, Alec said. Women love hearing my stories about shoots here and there, particularly Hollywood. They like hearing about movie stars. They want to know what the stars are really like, and when I tell them that what you see in the photograph is all you're likely to get, they don't believe me. They think I'm holding out on them.</p>
<p class="follow">And are you?</p>
<p class="follow">I don't know the stars. I only photograph them.</p>
<p class="follow">That sounds like a pleasant way to make a living. Pays well, doesn't it?</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, it does.</p>
<p class="follow">The locations are pleasant.</p>
<p class="follow">Most of the time, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Did you ever photograph Gary Cooper?</p>
<p class="follow">He died before I got into the business, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">I liked watching Gary Cooper. His films were everywhere in Europe before the war. I always thought Cooper represented a kind of ideal American, resolute but with an amusing side to him. Sympathetic to the underdog. Not a city man but rather a man of the West. A mountain man, I would say. Also a man of action, sure of himself but never a bully. A man of few words.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec nodded in agreement. Gary Cooper had been dead for decades.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec said, Did you ever meet Tito?</p>

<p class="follow">Andre laughed and said he had met Tito once during the war. Not a pleasant man but one with great personal force. Andre said, He wanted to bring my commando under his control, his orders, his objectives. I said I would think about it. He said I shouldn't take too long; too much thinking could be dangerous. He gave me this, Andre said, and pulled the ivory cigarette holder from his pocket. He said that would cement our friendship. Our collaboration under his control, his orders, his objectives. I got out of there damned fast, I can tell you. I refused to be under his orders or anyone's orders. When I told that story to Holder, he didn't believe me. But it happened all right. There were witnesses. Andre screwed a cigarette into the holder and struck a match, exhaling a fog of smoke that seemed to hang in the air forever.</p>
<p class="follow">I admire your life, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">I don't believe you.</p>
<p class="follow">You fought the right battles, Alec said. And you didn't wait for them to come to you. You went looking for them.</p>
<p class="follow">I fought the ones I could fight.</p>
<p class="follow">And paid the price. How many years were you in prison?</p>
<p class="follow">Many, many years. Twenty years, I suppose. More than that, I think.</p>
<p class="follow">I imagine even prison was worth it. If prison was the price.</p>
<p class="follow">You don't know what you're talking about. Prison is a terrible experience. You lose track of the world and the world loses track of you. Do you know that it took one man nine hours to dig one-half a cubic meter through the permafrost? And you did this day after day without knowing the purpose of the excavation. Your daily patch, one-half meter of soil. Some days each swing of the pick yielded a finger-sized piece of Siberian soil. The war was a terrible experience, too, but at least you are free more or less. You conduct your business in the open, not in a cell. You have something to show for the struggle. You can believe that what you are doing is worthwhile even if it is but a small part of a much larger picture. Often it was helpful not knowing the larger picture. The larger picture was not your business anyway. I still think of my half-meter. In any case, I survived.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, Alec said. How, exactly?</p>
<p class="follow">Andre moved his shoulders and did not reply.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm sorry I asked.</p>
<p class="follow">Luck, Andre said. And I have a strong constitution. Also, I was born at a particular time in a particular place. Life was always hard for my family. Later on the war was everywhere, inside and outside. I could not avoid it. No one could. The Nazis were a terrible cult and the Soviets not much better. Stalin was a gangster. Still, if you were forced to put your cards down, you'd put them down in Stalin's favor. That was the situation. The war was not an elective and a choice had to be made. That was how I saw it. I think I told you once that I have always looked for the absolute.</p>
<p class="follow">And were you disappointed?</p>
<p class="follow">Rarely, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">I had the belief that if I went to the war my photographs would make it beautiful. The very horror of it had a beautiful side also, the kind of beauty that's alluring. Bewitching I would say. It draws one in. Makes you larger than life. Did you ever read the <em>Iliad?</em></p>
<p class="follow">Of course. Many times.</p>
<p class="follow">Such beautiful poetry describing such appalling events.</p>
<p class="follow">But surely, Andre said with a wolfish smile, surely we would not be better off without the <em>Iliad.</em></p>
<p class="follow">Alec removed his eyeglasses and looked away in the direction of the street, his vision more fractured than usual. He ran his thumb over his lower lip as he often did when concentrating. But this time his concentration yielded nothing. Rain continued to fall through the trees and Alec did not see the visitor until he was a few steps away. The intruder wore a blue uniform and carried a heavy pack on his shoulder.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre said, Good morning, Vincent.</p>
<p class="follow">Good morning, Andre. Not much mail today.</p>

<p class="follow">Anything for me?</p>
<p class="follow">One letter. The postmark is smudged. I can't tell you where it came from.</p>
<p class="follow">Dubrovnik, Andre said when he looked at the letter.</p>
<p class="follow">Will you save me the stamp?</p>
<p class="follow">With pleasure, Vincent.</p>
<p class="follow">The postman nodded, handed Andre the rest of the mail, and went away.</p>
<p class="follow">Please, Alec said, read it now if you want.</p>
<p class="follow">I'll save it, Andre said. I know what's in it anyway. An old comrade wants me to send him some money. He is eternally in need of funds. He does not care to work and is too feeble to work if he did care. He doesn't have a trade in any case. Soldiering was his trade. So he writes me, and from time to time I send him fifty dollars, whatever I can spare. You were saying?</p>
<p class="follow">It gives me pause that the conditions of our world make the <em>Iliad</em> indispensable.</p>
<p class="follow">We are making progress, Andre said with a sour smile. Remember what Isaac Babel said. You must know everything.</p>
<p class="follow">It wasn't Babel who said it. His mother said it.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre thought a moment. Yes, that's right.</p>
<p class="follow">In order to survive the world. That's why she said it.</p>
<p class="follow">That is the sort of idea you get when you are born in Russia, Andre said. Your first thought is to pass it on to your children. He blew a fat smoke ring, evidently enjoying himself. What sort of photographs do you make?</p>
<p class="follow">I make still lifes, Alec said, except for the most part they are not arrangements of flowers or fruit but human beings and man-made objects. A doorway or a sailboat. A newsroom. I have photographed my own garden but readily confess that my garden is a sentimental subject. I have a knack for making beautiful pictures. They are pictures without obvious conflict and therefore I was miscast in the news. I have often wondered if I missed an opportunity when I refused to go to Vietnam.</p><p class="follow">I wouldn't worry about it. Your war was an elective.</p>
<p class="follow">I don't worry. I used to worry. And "missing an opportunity" is not exactly what I mean. What I did was not a business decision. Alec was silent a moment, and then he added, There's a sort of shame attached.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre rolled his eyes but said nothing.</p>
<p class="follow">That must be it. What else would it be?</p>
<p class="follow">That accounts for your—uneasiness?</p>
<p class="follow">You went, Alec said. You went without a second thought.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre sighed heavily. You refuse to listen, he said. I have been trying to say to you that we had no choice. I could not stand aside. My country was invaded. All the countries around me were invaded. Central Europe was disappearing. Try please to understand what that means. Your world is vanishing before your eyes without the slightest indication that anything you do will reverse the tide. Stop the rot. Make it cease. So you went to war and learned how to do it in the way that a carpenter learns how to make a chair. An artisan's work. But also you are free and whatever else your life may be, it is not still. I can see you are troubled. But I cannot help you.</p>
<p class="follow">So it was personal, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre's reply was swift. What else would it be?</p>
<p class="follow">Alec had left his eyeglasses off all this time. Now he replaced them and reached into his pocket for the Leica. Andre was relaxed in his chair, gently rocking, watching Vincent the postman work the opposite side of the street. This was an untroubled neighborhood, mature shade trees lining the streets, the hum of the city inaudible, spring turning slowly into summer. Even the rain was benevolent. Alec thought the street with its picture-perfect plant life and settled houses had the aspect of a film set, something from the conformist 1950s, a balalaika from an upstairs bedroom, Vincent the postman bursting into song as he danced from lawn to lawn. Alec thought, Time to leave this neighborhood to itself. He was an intruder.</p>

<p class="follow">Alec looked around him, at the porch with its heavy railing and the empty room behind the window. Andre stirred and said something unintelligible; he was talking to himself in Czech. Alec took a last sip of Turkish coffee and rose heavily, his knees hurting. He looked at his watch and saw that he had been sitting on the porch for almost two hours. Alec turned to say something to Andre but the old man's eyes were closed, his hands flat on his belly, fingers linked. Whatever dream he was having was peaceful, and even in repose his body had the hardness and everlastingness of permafrost or one of those solemn statues of Stalin that once stood in the squares of middle European cities. And then it occurred to him that he was not the intruder in this peaceable neighborhood. Andre Duran was. Alec stepped quietly off the porch and came around the lawn to face Andre head-on. He made two shots with the Leica, the shutter's click as quiet as the tick of a clock.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec turned his back and walked across the lawn to his car. As he opened the door he looked up to the rooftop of Goya House. Someone was standing on the widow's walk, still as a statue, dressed in a yellow oilskin slicker and a gardener's floppy hat. Alec recognized him as one of the soccer fans, looking now for all the world like a distressed widow scanning the horizon for signs of a ship's sail. Alec gave a wave but the figure on the roof took no notice. He looked due east, his hands gripping the flimsy railing, his concentration complete. Rain continued to fall and somewhere behind it Alec heard the balalaika's song.</p>
<p class="follow">He was in no rush. Alec turned the ignition of his car but did not drive away. He sat quietly looking at the great mercantile hulk of Goya House, lights visible here and there from the windows of the upper floors. Alec thought of it as a cathedral, with all the dark places and mystery of a cathedral, empty in midafternoon. He was certain now that he and Andre would not meet again. Their conversations had reached a dead end, and there was this: Andre's voice had changed when he spoke of Spain, his tone softer, almost feminine. Alec wondered if the heroic wish had given voice to the thought, a feat of the imagination. For one of Andre's generation Spain was a grail, the ur-struggle of the previous century. To be present there was to be present at the creation. Of course there were gaps in Andre's memory, things omitted or forgotten, glossed over, redacted and invented. Memories bore the same relation to the facts as distant cousins to a common grandfather. Yet was it not also true that the myths one lived by were the real stuff of life, its romance and surprise? Certainly the way one saw a much-loved grandfather was not the way he saw himself. Every life was subject to misapprehension; people saw what they wanted to see. The dance floor turned as the dancers waltzed. So stories were told to give a context to things. To give voice to the unspeakable. The listener either believed the account or did not. Often you hid your own face to see clearly the face of another. Alec believed Andre, and if he had a reservation about Spain, the reservation was unimportant. And Alec was sure Andre would say the same of him, with a reservation of his own. But what that reservation was, Alec could not say. Either way, Alec knew he was finished here. He listened hard for the balalaika but heard nothing. The figure in the yellow oilskin had vacated the widow's walk. Evidently the ship was not yet in view, so he had given it up. No doubt he would return at dusk or early the following morning and for as many days as was necessary.</p>
<p class="follow">As Andre said, you do not have the luxury of being certain about things, least of all the context of your own life.</p>
