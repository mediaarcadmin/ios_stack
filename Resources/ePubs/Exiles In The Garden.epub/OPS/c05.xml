<h1 class="chaptertitle">THE RED THREAD</h1>
<p class="left"><b>T</b><span style="font-size: smaller">HEIR PENSION</span> was situated on a quiet square bordered by shade trees. There were tables and chairs under the trees and a dour concessionaire who sold coffee and croissants from a cart. Traffic was light. Lucia bought stationery at the shop on the corner and settled herself at one of the tables with her coffee and croissant, a sheet of blank white paper before her. She wrote nothing for the longest time, watching pedestrians in the square while she organized her thoughts. The day was overcast but warm for October. Lucia was lulled by the quiet and the orderliness of the square. She smiled as an elderly couple passed in front of her, the man thickset from what appeared to be a lifetime of good living, the woman slender with an athletic spring to her step. Lucia tried to think of herself and Nikolas in forty years, living comfortably in Zurich or some other European city, still companionable, still in love. She found herself unable to peer far into the future. She could not imagine what they would look like, gray hair, a slower step certainly. She had seen an artist's projection of John F. Kennedy at seventy years old, jowls and thinning hair, eyeglasses; he looked like his father. Probably Nikolas would be a famous writer, a spokesman for his generation—<em>their</em> generation. That was what he wanted for himself but she was not sure she wanted it for him. People would stake claims. She thought about the various claims, invitations to conferences, speaking engagements. He would be expected to have an opinion about everything under the sun, so there would be no time for repose.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia watched the elderly couple stop at the concessionaire's for coffee, taking their time making a selection. She imagined the apartment they would have when Nikolas was famous, five or six rooms at least with a bedroom big enough for a desk so he could write at night. The desk would be long and deep to accommodate the manuscripts and reams of blank paper. The window would look out onto a city square, empty at night but in daytime filled with trees and flowers that would change with the seasons. They would have the apartment and a country place somewhere near a good piste for skiing in the winter—she wanted to watch the racers flying hell-bent top to bottom, success or failure measured in tenths of seconds—and for hiking the rest of the time. She wondered if Nikolas wanted children. They had not spoken of a family. There was plenty of time for that. Lucia knew that she was bourgeois to the core but she knew also that their apartment would become a salon, a gathering place for intellectuals. She looked at the blank sheet of paper before her and thought that it was much easier thinking about the future than the task at hand. She watched the elderly couple take their coffee to a table and sit, laughing about something; the woman was telling some story, her husband looking at her with an attitude of the utmost anticipation. They looked as if they had been together forever with the entire afternoon yet to come. They looked invulnerable. Lucia tasted her coffee and found it had grown cold. She drew the sheet of stationery close to her and after what seemed a long time began to write.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia wrote that she was unable to help herself. She had found the man she had desired her whole life and had come to assume did not exist. She thought he was an illusion, someone who inhabited her imagination. But that was not true. He was real. Nikolas Janos was real, he was heaven-sent to her and now he was inside her and all around her and it was the same with him. Do you remember Madame Brun? One night she described to me—us, but I think you were not listening carefully—the apparatus of the communist state. She called it a tapestry of many colors. A bright red thread ran through it. The thread ran both vertically and horizontally, described circles, arcs. Madame Brun said when you lived in such a state you could not move without running into the red thread; your personal life, your professional life, your work, your recreation, all of it circumscribed by the red thread. Didn't it sound ghastly? Worse than ghastly. But if you apply that picture to a lover—unable to move without finding him and happy that he is there—then it becomes not ghastly at all but sublime. That is the way it is with us. I feel as if I have been reborn, Lucia wrote. From the very beginning in America she had felt out of her depth, homesick one moment, clinging to Alec the next. She was so very young and without experience. She was lonely. Their first years together had been a dream, their little house with its rose garden, her work at the zoo. Alec was so attentive. Mathilde arrived. But then the dream began to come apart. She saw herself imprisoned in a glass cage; things were visible but she was unable to grasp them. Had he experienced that? She was displaced, her heart out of joint. She looked forward so to her evenings at the Count and Countess d'An's and almost at once she felt her world turn. The way I felt was lawless, she wrote. I was searching for excitement of the sort I knew as a young girl, not a piste this time but a soiree in the open air. I knew they were dangerous company, rootless unsettled people, not dangerous to themselves but definitely dangerous to others because they had so little to lose. I knew the house next door was unwholesome for me and for us and yet there was nothing I could do about it. I knew you hated the evenings at the d'Ans'. You cannot deny this. This was not a world you knew about or cared for. That is why I was so surprised when you suggested we live in Europe. I don't believe Europe is your place. I saw you arrive at our house—the back light went on, and I knew you were home—and sit alone in the garden until the party ended. You and your evenings of baseball and reverie and I was unable to share either one. And that drove us apart. And one night I tripped on a loose flagstone and my life changed and I knew nothing I could do would put it right. I was overwhelmed and without resources. Perhaps that is not entirely true: I had resources but they were put to selfish purposes. I tell you that the glass of my cage suddenly shattered and shattered glass cannot be made whole. Nikolas and I seduced each other, that's the truth of it. It did not begin that way but that was how it came to be. I have no regrets of it. I went to Zurich to see if I had lost my mind or found it. You must not blame yourself.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">Alec read her letter in the garden late one afternoon. He had not bothered to unsling his camera bag and it hung heavily from his shoulder, unnoticed. When he got to the part about Nikolas and Lucia seducing each other he tried to recall him, what he looked like and how he spoke, his bearing. And he remembered Nikolas quite well, a burly young man with a mop of dirty hair, a beaked nose and a heavy belly, a white scarf, a man easy to pick out in a crowd. He knew it, too. He was Hungarian or Polish, a youthful spirit despite his bulk, younger in age than heedless, overwhelmed Lucia. If there was danger, Alec had not seen it. He stared at the letter in his hand trying to recollect this Nikolas. He did not remember whether they had ever spoken. He thought not, though there were so many of them—Czechs, Bulgarians, Hungarians, Poles, Russians—in and out of the garden next door he could not be sure. They were all damaged goods, a second-rate theatrical troupe giving nightly performances of the heartbreak of central Europe. Alec had listened to them for hours at a time, achieving sympathy but not understanding. They did not seem to mind. Probably to understand them fully you had to have been there at the beginning, whenever the beginning was—Xerxes, Martin Luther, 1848, 1917, Munich in 1938. This Nikolas was too young to care about it. No, he wasn't. Heartbreak would be wired into his genes. Alec remembered that he had written a scandalous novel.</p>
<p class="follow">The light began to fail. From inside the house Mrs. Bazaroff called to him but he did not answer. Then he said, Just a moment, please, in a voice he knew was not his own. Alec continued reading but could not get the sense of what Lucia was writing. Something about Mathilde, something more about arrangements for custody and child support and the things she had left behind. It seemed to him she was writing in a foreign language, verbs and subjects in violent disagreement. One thought led to another without transition. Her handwriting was sloppy, the words aslant on the page in blue ink; the letters resembled sloops bearing into a brisk wind. They had had such a good time on Chesapeake Bay, perfect weather, the boat all you could ask for. Lucia thought that the motion of the sea and the smell of salt water was sexy. She said it again and again. She was right, too. They had sailed Chesapeake Bay for ten days and not had a conversation with another human being; instead, Lucia talked to the crabs. Something childlike about it but wondrous also. He had taught her how to sail, explained the difference between the main and the jib, compass bearings, the tides. She was a natural. He remembered that they were going to buy a boat but never got around to it. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Mrs. Bazaroff in the doorway, and then she turned her back and moved silently into the house. Alec came to the end of Lucia's letter understanding no more of what he was reading except that she was gone and would not return. Zurich was her home. Her life she would share with Nikolas. Alec could not imagine what had gone wrong so suddenly except of course he was not to blame himself, whatever it was. Alec realized that she had not given his last name, as if Nikolas was all her husband needed for a positive identification. Then he returned to the beginning of the letter and saw that she had. But her handwriting was so bad that he could not read it exactly. His name was Janos or Junot, something like that.</p>
<p class="follow">Inside the house the telephone rang but Mrs. Bazaroff did not answer and the caller gave up. Alec folded the letter and stood tapping it against his thumbnail. That morning he had been in Des Moines, at a rally for a Democratic House candidate; Hubert Humphrey was the featured speaker. Humphrey and Kim Malone were close friends and allies, so the former vice president invited Alec into his hotel suite to photograph him with the candidate and his advisers, an important strategy meeting, one last push to save the Senate and the House for the Democrats. Humphrey looked exhausted, his face drained of color. He and the candidate and the advisers had been talking about the war, a discussion that had left them dispirited. Alec sent the photograph by wire to the newspaper and his editor was delighted, an exclusive shot, Humphrey jowls-to-the-floor. Take a week off, Alec. Spend some time with your family. Alec caught a midday flight to O'Hare and two hours later a nonstop to Washington, all in all an easy day. He had not heard from Lucia in weeks but he had the idea she would be waiting for him when he returned, a surprise; and Mathilde had been out of sorts, wondering where her mother was.</p>
<p class="follow">He had bought something for Mathilde in Iowa but now couldn't remember what it was. The letter still in his hand, Alec walked to the rear of the garden to look at the yellow roses, dim in the half-light. He thought they needed water. Washington was in a state of autumn drought. Roses never grew as nicely in this garden as they had in the small garden that measured twelve by twenty feet. Probably it was the soil. Perhaps the light was wrong. Roses needed beaucoup sunshine to thrive. But drought was the real enemy. Of course the garden was too crowded, too many varieties of plant life. The nasturtiums and hollyhocks were especially frumpish. He wondered if he should try to buy back his old house. This one was too large for him now. Interior spaces weren't all they were cracked up to be. Alec turned on the sprinkler and listened to the hiss of the spray.</p>
<p class="follow">He returned to Lucia's letter in order to read the last sentence once more. He held the paper close to his eyes, the light was so poor. Really, it was only ambient light reflected from the clouds that hung low over Washington.</p>
<p class="follow">I tried so hard, she wrote.</p>
<p class="follow">Mrs. Bazaroff called again from the interior but Alec did not reply. He was testing the sincerity of Lucia's last sentence. He read it again and again, a heartbreaking four-word sentence. He wondered if it had come to her naturally or if she had to think about it, her pen between her teeth, trying one line after another until she found the one that struck a clear note. He supposed she was sincere. There would be no reason why she would want to lie at such a time. Lying was not in her nature. Lucia had always been straightforward. Forthright would be the word, a quality the Swiss were meant to have in abundance, along with a tremendous capacity for affection. Well, probably the Swiss were no more affectionate than anyone else—Americans, say, or Hungarians. Affection came hard in a cold climate, witness the Germans. Alec thought back over her letter, her attempts at explanation (if that was the word), and concluded she had help writing it. The phrases seemed to come from another culture or, more pointedly, another decade, a decade in the future, perhaps the 1980s. No one knew what the eighties would bring. Each decade had its signature. The Silent Generation of postwar conformity; the Me Generation; in the twenties it was dancing barefoot in the fountain of the Plaza Hotel; in the sixties stoned at Woodstock. Alec thought Lucia's letter was prophetic in some way he could not explain. <em>The way I felt was lawless.</em> Assisted or not, he believed she was writing from some future time. In a decade or two her letter would achieve coherence. <em>I tried so hard,</em> and perhaps she had. All the same, Alec felt she had clubbed him in the stomach.</p>
<p class="follow">He turned away, his mind filled with static, harsh and unintelligible. Darkness gathered. When Alec looked up he saw only the thin layer of clouds that shrouded the Washington sky. No stars were visible. Alec stared at the blank slate above and concluded he had put faith in the wrong system, the one that was misleading, well out of date. He had misunderstood the cosmos. He had held with the Ptolemaic system in which the sun eternally revolved around the earth when there was much evidence to the contrary. In order to keep faith he had done what the medieval people had done, proposed that the sun moved around the earth while at the same time the planets moved around the sun. The dance floor revolved as the dancers waltzed, everything in motion. There were no fixed points in the universe. This seemed to give them comfort, and in due course they tried Galileo for heresy. Alec smiled at this thought as he continued to gaze at the concealed heavens. After a moment he turned to walk back into his house.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia will not return, Alec said to Mrs. Bazaroff. She is remaining in Europe.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">It had taken Alec twenty minutes to tell the story but his father had drifted away after five, barely into the hors d'oeuvres. He heard nothing about the count and countess, Ambassador Kryg, Nikolas Janos, or Lucia's father. Nothing about sailing on the Chesapeake Bay or the ordeal of Ed Weekes. Alec continued anyhow to give an account of those early days which had apparently been so mysterious to his father. When he fini shed talking his voice was barely a whisper. The old man was sleeping soundly now, his face waxen but his breathing regular as a metronome. He looked older when he was asleep than awake. Looking at him, Alec had a feeling not of consanguinity but of longevity; they had been in the way of each other for a very long time. Rarely did a day pass without his father entering his thoughts in one guise or another. When the nurse looked in, Alec asked her how long the old man had. She said it was hard to know, and in any case she did not do predictions. Alec said, Take a guess, I won't hold you to it. The nurse thought a moment and said, More than a week but less than a month. He was failing obviously, each day a trial, but his heart was strong.</p>
<p class="follow">He likes it when you come, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">I know he does, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">He looks forward to it. He asks me to read the headlines in the paper so he's up on things. The war, the election.</p>
<p class="follow">He has most of his marbles, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Was he really a senator?</p>
<p class="follow">Really was, Alec said. A good one, too.</p>
<p class="follow">Sometimes, you know, they make things up. We have the king of Sweden down the hall. Every few days he calls one of us in to announce a Nobel Prize. Harmless old man, sweet-tempered. She smiled briefly and said, Stay as long as you like, I'll be back to check on him in an hour.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec stepped to the window and looked out. The hour was late and it was nearly dark except for the lights on the lawn of the hospital. He saw activity on the sixteenth green and cupped his eyes to the glass so he could see better. It took him a moment to focus. A boy stood in the sand trap lofting ball after ball to the green. He would hit one shot and drop a fresh ball and hit another. After each shot he carefully raked the sand, as any professional caddie would do. The boy looked to be no more than ten or twelve years old, tall for his age and skinny, probably one of the weekend caddies or the son of a member who lived nearby. Then Alec noticed an older man standing off to one side, his arms folded across his chest, watching the play with fatherly pride. There were a dozen or more golf balls on the green, some of them only inches from the cup. The boy was a prodigy. Finally he gave a last sweep of the rake, collected the balls on the green, and walked off down the fairway with his father. Through the open window Alec heard their companionable laughter.</p>
<p class="follow">Then he was in his car and driving back to Washington, thinking about the boy practicing sand shots. Doubtless he saw himself one day as a member of the PGA Tour, making a Sunday run at the Masters or the British Open, knocking a sand shot two inches from the pin, applause filling his ears and trying not to notice because applause was a distraction, a concentration breaker. The point wasn't the applause, the point was the ball in the cup. Alec had caddied occasionally for his father on weekend afternoons, the men talking politics as they lined up putts. Alec would drift off into one of his reveries and forget to remove the flag or follow the line of his father's drive as it sliced right into the rough. He would be thinking about the blond-haired girl in geometry class or what he had planned for the weekend. His father would yell at him, <em>Watch the goddamned ball,</em> and Alec would come to just soon enough to follow the ball's flight, bending right into the rough and bouncing into the woods, out of bounds. His father barely noticed. Ball flight was Alec's assignment. By then the senator was engrossed in a discussion of the supplemental appropriation, completely screwed up by the idiots in the House. When he reached the ball and found it unplayable he picked it up and lofted it back onto the fairway, still talking about the House and what was to be done. Alec decided he was not made to be someone's caddie, especially his father's caddie.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec turned on the radio, German music from the classical station.</p>
<p class="follow">Traffic was light in early evening but he was driving slowly, troubled by the lights of oncoming cars. His eyes were getting worse each day. He had difficulty reading the newspaper in the morning, though by noontime he was focusing all right. Alec plodded past the Pentagon and over the Fourteenth Street Bridge to the Jefferson Memorial, reflected unsteadily on the corrugated surface of the Tidal Basin. The reflection looked like one of Pollock's expressionist canvases.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec was trying not to think about the story he had told the old man—early days in Washington, something out of the ordinary, something unexpected, his mysterious life—but that proved difficult. He had never spoken the whole story—beginning, middle, and end—to anyone. When he was younger he had ruminated on it often, measuring the what-ifs. He had long since decided that the events of those years were fated. He believed he had the story correct in its essentials: the house next door, the exiles in the garden, Lucia's fascination with the Count and Countess d'An, and his own strange brooding on the Ptolemaic system of fathoming the cosmos, a reverie sure enough. They really had called the White House "the Palace" and Walta Bin-yameen was a frequent reference. And Alec truly was the last to know, and from that he concluded that he was incapable of grasping how people actually behaved; he had never counted himself a prophet. He supposed that all the guests-of-many-languages were gone now. If the Count and Countess d'An were alive they would be of very great age, early nineties at least. A year or so after Lucia left him, Alec had a letter from the d'Ans in Kleinwalsertal. Nikolas and Lucia had come for a visit while they were touring southern Germany. Mathilde was with them. Such a charming child, Alec. You must be very proud. Lucia looked well. No mention was made of Nikolas. Tactful silence, Alec thought at the time, though simple negligence may have been closer to the mark. Alec had not answered the letter.</p>
<p class="follow">It did not occur to him to try to win her back. That door was closed and locked, no light visible from her side or his. She was gone and that was the end of it. The next day he gave notice at the newspaper. They were not pleased that he had quit in the midst of an election campaign, for God's sake. But Alec sensed relief also; he had always been miscast, never part of the team. That afternoon he walked to K Street for a conversation with Eliot Bergruen, who promised to do what was best for him and for Mathilde once he heard what Lucia wanted and whom she had hired as her lawyer. Was Lucia a fit mother? Yes, Alec said, she was. Leave this in my hands, Eliot said. When I know more I will call you and we can decide what to do. That is to say, how far we can go. You must provide me with a list of your assets, beginning with the house.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm sorry, Alec.</p>
<p class="follow">So am I, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Was she ever happy here?</p>
<p class="follow">In the beginning, Alec said. And toward the end.</p>
<p class="follow">The lawyer gave a fleeting smile. I understand.</p>
<p class="follow">Can I ask you a question, Eliot?</p>
<p class="follow">The smile vanished. Go ahead.</p>
<p class="follow">Did you ever feel you might have taken a different path? Run for the Senate like my father. Gone into the government.</p>
<p class="follow">I was in the government, Alec. I worked in Lend-Lease.</p>
<p class="follow">Stayed in the government, then.</p>
<p class="follow">The lawyer leaned back in his chair, hands locked behind his head, staring at the ceiling. He said, Naturally you're upset. Take a month off, get away from things. I have learned in my life that clear thinking arises from repose, intervals of noninterference. Recreation, if you will. One returns to one's task refreshed. I have learned also that nine out of ten problems solve themselves if you leave them alone. Let nature do its work. By nature I mean fate.</p>
<p class="follow">And the tenth?</p>
<p class="follow">You take the tenth by the throat.</p>
<p class="follow">And that's why you didn't remain in the government?</p>
<p class="follow">I was not speaking of the government, Alec.</p>

<p class="follow">Or choose one path instead of another.</p>
<p class="follow">You have suffered a shock. Your task is to get the shock out of your system. Never look back, that's the key. The backward glance is the guarantor of an unhappy life. Strangely enough, I learned that in the government. What was a waste of time and what wasn't. Good luck to you, Alec. I'll be in touch.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">The next day Alec took his clothes to the dry cleaner, then continued down the street to the park. He sat on a bench under a shade tree and watched a group of Georgetown students, all with open books, listening to their instructor. Then they took their places and began to read, evidently a rehearsal in the open air. They seemed to be concentrating intensely, reading, he now understood, Shakespeare. When they took a break Alec asked the instructor if he could make photographs, he was from the newspaper. The instructor gave his permission and the students gave theirs and Alec began to shoot, remembering the afternoon at the theater off Connecticut Avenue. He shot with mounting excitement, staying out of their lines of sight, making his camera disappear, attempting to intercept the awkwardness and innocence of amateurs. He returned the next day and the day after, and when he fini shed with the actors he photographed playgrounds and parks, an empty swing, an empty bench, a tennis court at dusk, a beech tree with initials laboriously carved in its trunk. Mostly the photographs were without people, but now and again he made a long shot of a solitary figure on a park bench or looking into a store window. Of course he understood that the shots reflected his closed-down state of mind, the unconscious orbit of the sleepwalker.</p>
<p class="follow">Something had been lost that could never be regained. Some doors, once locked, never opened again. No one had the will. The eventual show, at one of the M Street galleries, was a success, especially the shots of the student actors. That winter Alec took his camera to Annapolis, photographing boats at anchor, under sail, in dry dock. He concentrated on dry dock. Wrapped in canvas tarpaulins, the vessels looked like sleeping beasts. Alec rented a sloop and sailed alone in Chesapeake Bay, freezing cold. But the deserted coves and harbors made wonderful material.</p>
<p class="follow">One night he put in at St. Michaels, moored the sloop, and went ashore for dinner. After dinner the bar was crowded. Alec looked in for a nightcap and at once found himself in conversation with a cameraman—he called himself a cinematographer—on the job in picturesque St. Michaels. They were shooting a movie, second-unit stuff, two scenes only on the harbor. A low-budget affair, Tommy confided, but the dailies looked very good. They talked shop for an hour. Alec explained that he was now freelance but had worked for a newspaper in Washington for ten years. At last he was free of that.</p>
<p class="follow">Tommy said, I thought Washington was exciting. A good gig.</p>
<p class="follow">It's only the government, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Then a woman was at Alec's elbow. Who's your friend, Tommy?</p>
<p class="follow">Annalise, meet Alec. Alec, meet Annalise Amiral. She's the actress I was telling you about. A pro. Beautiful to work with.</p>
<p class="follow">Tommy wandered off and Alec bought Annalise one drink, then another. She described for him the plot of the movie, in which she played a femme fatale. The movie could be her big break if it was produced properly. If money was spent on promotion. The script was not bad at all. What are you doing here, by the way?</p>
<p class="follow">Taking pictures of shipyards and boats, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">It's winter, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">The shipyards and boats don't care, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">And where do you live when you're not photographing shipyards and boats?</p>

<p class="follow">Washington, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">I lived in Washington for a while. My father is a congressman.</p>
<p class="follow">You're kidding me.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm not kidding you.</p>
<p class="follow">Mine is a senator.</p>
<p class="follow">I loved politics, Annalise said. My father used to take me campaigning when I was little. Held me on his shoulders when he made a street-corner walk-by, all the matrons oohing and aahing. Good symbolism, my dad said, attentive father, family man. His opponents said he was exploiting a five-year-old. I loved it. "Judah Jones is on your side." That was his campaign slogan. Balanced budget, that was his signature issue. They loved it in Winnetka where everyone's budget was so large it never had to be balanced.</p>
<p class="follow">So he's a Republican, Alec said. Mine's a Democrat.</p>
<p class="follow">He ever take you campaigning?</p>
<p class="follow">No, Alec said. I was not an adorable child.</p>
<p class="follow">Hah, she said. I was.</p>
<p class="follow">I can believe it.</p>
<p class="follow">Then I didn't like politics so much. I liked boys instead. We only lived in Washington a few years. My mother didn't like it. She had work of her own. So we moved back to Winnetka and my father commuted. He still does. Commute.</p>
<p class="follow">Later on, the bar almost empty, Annalise confided that she had been married but the marriage hadn't worked out. Her husband was not in the entertainment business and that was difficult because the business was all-consuming. You didn't want it to be but it was. Her husband was the only lawyer in Los Angeles who had nothing to do with the entertainment business. He specialized in patents, so at the end of the day they had nothing much to talk about and drifted apart as people tended to do when the evenings were marked by silence. Alec said he understood about drift. He had been married but was no longer. His wife had left him for a Hungarian layabout. His daughter lived with his ex-wife and the layabout in Switzerland.</p>
<p class="follow">Did she meet him in Washington?</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, she did.</p>
<p class="follow">I didn't know Hungarian layabouts lived in Washington.</p>
<p class="follow">This one did, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">I met a British layabout once. Never a Hungarian.</p>
<p class="follow">You probably didn't live in Georgetown.</p>
<p class="follow">Chevy Chase, Annalise said.</p>
<p class="follow">Well, that explains it.</p>
<p class="follow">What do you suppose attracted your wife to the Hungarian?</p>
<p class="follow">That's a good question, Alec said. I'm damned if I know. I'm sure it was an affair of the heart.</p>
<p class="follow">There are lots of those in Washington, Annalise said.</p>
<p class="follow">Evidently, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">My father had an affair, a girl in his office. My mother put a stop to it. She put her foot down. And so the affair went away and they continued as before. Annalise smiled devilishly and finished her cognac. I'm free tomorrow, she said. What are you doing?</p>
<p class="follow">Sailing, Alec said. Come along. We'll have a picnic.</p>
<p class="follow">I'll bring my mittens, Annalise said.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">Alec parked the car a block from his house and walked slowly up the brick sidewalk. The night was warm, seasonable in April, and no one was about, though he thought he heard music in the vicinity. He passed Admiral Honeycutt's old house and Ronald diAntonio's next to it, both men long, long gone. The count and countess's grand house was sold years before by the lawyers and had passed into other hands twice more before the sale, last year, to an oil man who did something important in the present administration, Alec had forgotten what it was. There was a time when he knew the names of every cabinet member in the government in order to successfully complete his father's dinner table decathlon. He had never met his important neighbor but he did often see the Vietnamese houseman carrying dry cleaning to and from the shop on the corner. The first thing the oil man did was tear up the tennis court and replace it with a gazebo surrounded by hedges and magnolia trees and, implausibly, a giant cactus; the cactus reminded him of Paul d'An's stag's head. Alec had come to think of the house next door as emblematic of the change of administrations. Each new owner put his stamp on the property. A fountain and a giant cedar made way for a tennis court as years later the tennis court made way for a cactus. Idle aristocrats made way for foulmouthed lawyers who made way for Republican oil men. Next year or the year after the cactus would yield to a state-of-the-art lap pool so the new owners could keep fit. In the old days everyone stayed on, lured by the capital's hospitality and sense of occasion and unquestioned authority. And if all you knew was politics and government, where else would you want to make a life? The exceptions were the ex-presidents, who felt obliged to go home to Johnson City or Atlanta or some address of convenience like Palm Springs or San Clemente, returning to Washington for funerals of statesmen like themselves. Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and the elder Bush had all known the capital as young men and could not fail to remark on the changes. The grandes dames were gone. The elder statesmen were gone. The small town of their youth was now a metropolis spilling over into the Virginia and Maryland countryside, farther each year. When you looked at the downtown, with its barriers and snipers on the roof of the White House, you could believe you were living in a garrison state. Alec noticed that his street was crowded with German automobiles, the large versions.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec had lived on this street for more than half his lifetime, a fixture now like the vanished grandes dames. That came at a price. Now and then a neighbor would pause in front of his house, the neighbor's voice audible through the open windows, explaining the charm of the surroundings, the sense of continuity and history.</p>
<p class="follow">That little place belongs to Alec Malone, the photographer. He's been here practically forever, at least since the Kennedy administration. I believe they knew each other well, Alec and the president. Played golf together. Went cruising on the <em>Honey Fitz.</em> Was a guest often at Hyannisport and Palm Beach and Glen Ora. Went girl-chasing together. There isn't anyone in this town that Alec Malone hasn't photographed, though for many years he's worked mainly abroad and on the West Coast. Private man, keeps to himself. That's what's good about Washington, the links from one generation to the next. In Washington the past is always prologue, you see. Malone's father was an important senator, friend of FDR. Why, you could say that Alec Malone goes back to the New Deal.</p>
<p class="follow">Live long enough in Washington, Alec thought, and they give you bells on your clothes and a false face, like a jester or a Kabuki dancer. They made you a legend.</p>
<p class="follow">His house was ablaze with lights. Alec always left the lights on believing they discouraged burglars. And to think that in the sixties he and Lucia never locked the front door day or night. Alec paused by the table in the hall and leafed through the mail, half a dozen bills and circulars and a letter from Mathilde, a long one judging from the weight of the envelope, postmarked London. Alec put the letter aside to read over dinner. He always gave her letters his closest attention. He walked into the kitchen, made a drink, and in seconds was settled in his wicker chair in the back yard. His roses were coming into bloom, especially lovely this evening. Next door the oil man was giving a noisy party complete with fiddle and guitar ensemble playing southwestern music. The very air seemed to vibrate with it. Alec heard the rattle of glassware and women's soprano voices. He listened for foreign accents but heard none, unless you counted the southern accents. And then, quite distinctly, he heard rapid Spanish. A sudden pause in the conversation told him that someone important had arrived. The pause was short, no more than a beat or two, then conversation resumed louder than before. There was a musical term for it, ostinato, a phrase or rhythm repeated again and again.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec looked at his watch, bringing it close to his eyes in the darkness. Eight o'clock. The count's menagerie was always gone by a little after eight. Charles removed the champagne and the party ended. All those guests-of-many-languages were either dead or returned home or living in Switzerland. The captive nations were no longer captive, unless you considered global capitalism a kind of captivity. That, apparently, was Nikolas Janos's view, according to Mathilde. Nikolas and Lucia had only recently moved to Prague after living in Zurich for so many years. They also kept a small apartment in Berlin. Alec sipped his drink thoughtfully and listened to the party next door.</p>
<p class="follow">Someone fluttered a knife against crystal and the southwestern music stopped. Conversation tailed away and then ceased. The oil man was introducing his special guest. It was an honor having him there, a man of strength and commitment, a very great American, a man of faith, a man who took no prisoners, the government was lucky to have him and didn't deserve him, a man willing to sacrifice so much including the precious gift of privacy ... And then someone began to clap and the others joined in. Applause gathered, here and there a cheer. The special guest apparently declined to answer his host, for in a moment normal conversational ostinato resumed. Southwestern music resumed. Alec slipped into silent thought once more. The Morocco trip was definitely off. He would call Annalise in the morning, attempt another plan. He missed her, missed her easiness, her jokes, her repose turned abruptly to bird-on-the-wing. Perhaps they could meet somewhere else, New York or Los Angeles, when she finished her shoot. She was at her most irresponsible after finishing a film. Alec believed his father had weeks left, maybe more than weeks. But he deserved company in the time he had left. There was little enough Alec could do, but the old man deserved his best effort. Alec slowly sipped his drink and looked through his reverie room, this time giving himself over to the meaning of the red thread and where Annalise fit in.</p>
