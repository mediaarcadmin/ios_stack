<h1 class="chaptertitle">ANNALISE</h1>
<p class="left"><b>T</b><span style="font-size: smaller">HEY FINISHED SHOOTING</span> a week early, leaving Annalise at loose ends. Alec was delayed in Washington, waiting with his father for the long-nosed man who did seem to be taking his own sweet time. The senator mostly slept, unresponsive except for a grunt or nonsense word. Alec was subdued, remarking only that the old man's spirit was somewhere between a snowflake and nothing. When Annalise asked if he would like her to join him, he thanked her and said no; surely they would be together in a week, perhaps less. She did not press him.</p>
<p class="follow">Annalise went to Marrakech for three days, staying at the good hotel near the souk. The heat was unbearable. She rented a car and drove to Agadir for the weekend but the beach was uninhabitable owing to the desert wind. She read during the day and at night dined alone in the hotel restaurant. Her last night she was joined by a young couple from Chicago. Annalise knew the city well and they stayed at table long after the room had cleared, talking of Chicago and its colorful politics and adventurous theater. They were lawyers who specialized in environmental issues; they majored in the environment but had a minor in political law, grand jury work and matters of that kind. When they asked her what she did, Annalise replied that she was a fashion consultant. Strange, the young woman said, you really resemble the actress—and she could not remember the actress's name.</p>
<p class="follow">Annalise Amiral, Annalise said.</p>
<p class="follow">That's the one, the young woman said. You look so much like her, Judy.</p>
<p class="follow">It happens all the time, Annalise said.</p>
<p class="follow">The next day she flew to Tangier, a city she had first visited in the late 1960s. She had never seen a place like it. The Bowleses and William Burroughs more or less led the expatriate community, remarkably louche and unbuttoned. Everyone drank all day long and the nights were wild and without restraint of any kind. She was on the fringes of a crowd that went from café to café and then split up into groups of three or four to finish the evening in someone's apartment, smoking hash and playing strip poker. When you woke in the morning you had no idea who you were with. Everyone was obliged to reintroduce themselves so there would be a name to go with the body. Tangier seemed to exist outside the normal rules, the rules not so much ignored as forgotten. Certainly there were other cities like Tangier elsewhere in the world but Annalise had never seen one; she carried the memories her whole life.</p>
<p class="follow">Almost forty years later Tangier seemed to her to have grown sedate. Of course the Bowleses and Burroughs were gone. Tennessee Williams was gone. There seemed to her fewer Americans and more Germans. She saw a busload of Asians in straw hats and sunglasses. The cafés were lively and the streets crowded and, as always, you avoided the noonday sun. The odor of hash was present but not ubiquitous and now seemed self-conscious; and then Annalise had cause to reflect that she was no longer young, and what seemed so lurid to her then was the norm today. Tangier had not receded. Other cities had caught up, the sex trade as much a part of GDP as dates or olives. She called Alec and left a long message on his answering machine describing Tangier and its white light and Asian tourists, the somnolence of midday, the crystal blue of the Mediterranean. She called the city Babylon in aspic. How is your father? Call me at the hotel. She told him that she thought it was time for her to return to America.</p>
<p class="follow">She put in at a small hotel near the port and spent her first day revisiting old haunts. The next morning she bought the American newspaper and settled in at the café around the corner, the one she remembered from her first visit. She ordered a croissant and a café crème, looking around the café to see if there was anyone who looked interesting. When she opened the paper she gave a start. Ingmar Bergman was dead. She put the paper aside and when the waiter came she asked him for a pony of cognac on the side. She looked again at the paper with its grainy photograph, the great director with his left eye screwed into a camera's lens. He was gaunt, probably about forty years old when the shot was made. Annalise sipped her coffee and read the obit all the way through. So many films. So many liaisons, wives and girlfriends, multiple children from the multiple liaisons. She wondered if the two went hand in hand. In Bergman's case they seemed to. She stared again at the photograph and thought that it was as if one of the world's great languages had disappeared from the repertoire, vanished like the dialects of central Europe and the steppes of Asia. No one would ever speak it again. It was mothballed in film.</p>
<p class="follow">More coffee, she said to the waiter.</p>
<p class="follow">Her one regret in her professional life was that she had never made a film with Ingmar Bergman. Of course such a thing was impossible. Bergman had his own Swedish repertory company, von Sydow, Ullmann, and the others, and rarely used foreign actors, especially American actors. She had seen <em>The Seventh Seal</em> as a child and understood very little but seemed to feel it all; the enigma of the film reached to her very soul. She believed enigma was at the heart of both art and existence. She wished to understand the essence of enigma and thought Ingmar Bergman could point the way. Annalise tried a dozen ways to meet him and never succeeded. Once she saw him at a restaurant in Cannes, Annalise quite openly staring as he sat talking to a friend. She looked away a moment, and when she looked back he was gone, and a moment later she imagined him magically transported to that island he lived on, Faro, the place in the Baltic near Denmark, treeless and windswept, forlorn, the one place in the world where, he said, he felt safe. Years went by, her film career prospered, and she knew she would never meet Ingmar Bergman, let alone make a film with him. The one regret became part of her private personality, an invisible wound. It was her secret, which she shared with no one except Alec Malone. Her husband would not have understood. Invisible wounds were not in his inventory of useful patents. He had even less interest in enigma.</p>
<p class="follow">When Alec said he understood completely, that most everyone had something of the sort, Annalise smiled and said, Did it ruin your life?</p>
<p class="follow">Of course not, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Bergman didn't ruin mine, either.</p>
<p class="follow">But it's there, isn't it?</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, she said. Yes, it is.</p>
<p class="follow">Annalise sipped her coffee and read the newspaper, news of Iraq and the unstable stock market; it seemed that many Americans were encouraged to buy houses for more money than they could afford to pay and now the payments were coming due. Surprise all around. Bergman had had a tax problem and exiled himself from Sweden, a move so painful that he suffered a nervous breakdown, and it was the Swedish government that apologized eventually. She dipped in and out of the newspaper all the while keeping an eye on the comings and goings in the café. Business was slack. In a far corner, at a table near a potted plant, someone was being interviewed. He did not look like an actor—more likely an athlete, a footballer or tennis star. He was talking and the reporter was transcribing every word, her pen racing across the pad. She had an avid look that Annalise recognized, having been interviewed often over the years, in the beginning milk-and-honey pieces in <em>Screen</em> and the other fan magazines. But as movies began to be taken more seriously the actors began to be taken more seriously too, and the questions became more pointed and intrusive from reporters who took themselves equally seriously. To Annalise the salient question was put delicately because in Hollywood it was seen as fundamentally insulting—and in Washington so insulting it would not be put at all, if the reporter wanted to remain on good terms with his source. But Annalise did not take reporters seriously, so when she answered it was often with a wisecrack or a confounding and unhelpful Darned if I know. The question was a variation on the following: Do you think you would have gone farther if you had been more ambitious? Fought a little harder? Demanded more? Did your temperament hold you back? Onscreen it seemed you were always out of range of the brightest lights. Everyone predicted great things—and here there were references to reviews in the national newspapers and newsmagazines—but the great things never quite materialized. One Oscar nomination. One Golden Globe. Or have I got the wrong end of the stick?</p>
<p class="follow">And that was when Annalise replied with her easy smile, Darned if I know. Had she felt inclined to enlighten her interviewer, so svelte, so British, leaning forward in her chair, her pen beating a little tattoo on the blank page of her notebook, her expression professionally sympathetic (she had aspirations in the business herself, it was obvious, and thought she might hear something of value, some insight that she might put to her own use somewhere down the line), Annalise would have added:</p>
<p class="follow">The perfect performance does not exist. For a few moments an actor could hold fire in her hands. But her fingers would open and the fire turn to embers. The audience might not be aware. The moment was fleeting. And there were so many externals, the lighting, the dimensions of the frame and what occupies the frame. The pentimento of the frame. It's an enigma, you see.</p>
<p class="follow">I have had an extremely enjoyable life in the movies.</p>
<p class="follow">I liked the work. The work liked me.</p>
<p class="follow">The camera liked me. I have made a very good living.</p>
<p class="follow">Perhaps there could have been more. But it is as likely that there would have been much less.</p>
<p class="follow">Had my temperament not, as you said, held me back.</p>
<p class="follow">Now scram.</p>
<p class="follow">Still—she thought of this as she watched a flutist attempting to coax a cobra from a wicker basket, tourists gathered on the sidewalk—there were things that might have been done differently. Her given name was Judy Jones, but when the studio put her under contract her agent insisted she change it. Her looks were so unusual that he thought something European was apt, so he suggested Annalise Amiral and she agreed at once, not without misgivings. An unwholesome precedent, she thought. If you surrendered your name so easily, what else would you surrender? Yet wasn't it all make-believe? You played a made-up character in a made-up story, the product of a dozen typewriters. What difference if your name was made up also? Later on, when the Renée Zellwegers and Parker Poseys came along, she realized she should have objected. She should have pushed back. Pushing back gave you respect. Pushing back signaled that you were one tough customer, not to be trifled with or condescended to. And she knew her agent's reply: in the history of the motion picture industry there has never been a star called Judy except for Garland, and that's very bad luck. She also knew in her heart that she wasn't an especially tough customer. She was Judy Jones from Winnetka, high school cheerleader, president of the drama club, field hockey captain, backstroke champion—and the stands surrounding the pool were near full at the girls' meets because that Jones girl looked superb in a tank suit. She was an adored only child. Her mother was a buyer of women's fashions at Marshall Field's. Her father was a popular congressman, a moderate Republican, no stranger to compromise; for that and for other reasons he drank more than was good for him and died at fifty-five after ten terms in the House of Representatives. Judah Jones objected to the agent-supplied nom de théâtre—for crissakes, Judy, you don't look any more European than I do—but never failed to come to the opening of her films, no matter the city. He was tall and broad, so tall and broad that when she was a little girl and walked with him she could not see his head when she looked up, only his long arms leading to his shoulders. His voice, a congressional tenor, seemed to come from the heavens. Her mother remarried a year after his death, but by then Annalise was living in Los Angeles. She did not care for the man her mother married, a property developer with houses in Florida and Phoenix. Her mother took up golf and quit her job with Field's. So they grew apart.</p>
<p class="follow">When Annalise was with the young Chicago couple in Agadir she mentioned her father, asking if they had met him in their political work. No, they hadn't. Republican, wasn't he? Yes, she said, he was, and mentioned his committees. An apologetic smile: We're Democrats. As if that mattered.</p>
<p class="follow">The flutist had managed to charm the cobra to the edge of the basket, its head swaying drunkenly to the music. The half-dozen tourists took a collective step back. Annalise thought the poor creature looked exhausted, as if it had been roused from a siesta. On cue it collapsed again into the basket. The flutist gave a little push with his shoe, nudging the basket an inch or two. He produced a long single note from the flute, evidently the signal to dance, but he was unsuccessful. The cobra continued to lay doggo. The tourists waited a minute more before moving off to the next sidewalk entertainment. One of the women dropped a copper coin into the purse next to the basket and the flutist frowned, most disappointed.</p>
<p class="follow">Annalise paid her bill and rose. Her cognac sat where the waiter had put it, untouched. In the corner the reporter was talking into a cell phone. The athlete had disappeared. She thought she had made a mistake remaining in Morocco. She knew no one in Morocco; all the old crowd had moved away. Many were dead. That was a part of her life that was amusing to look back on—hilarious, really, everyone so footloose and ardent, unafraid. Tangier was a parallel universe with its own language and code of conduct. Now they call it living in the moment. But where else were you supposed to live? And when you had had enough you went back to the other. Annalise left the American newspaper on the table after one last glance at hypnotic Ingmar Bergman. He had seduced all those others and surely he would have seduced her, too; and if he didn't, she would have done the honors. But there would have been no children because she was badly wired. Probably that would have been a disappointment to him.</p>
<p class="follow">She walked into the street. The snake charmer was gone. A breeze had come up and blew dust in her face. She felt the heat of the desert. Annalise thought the buildings were shabbier than they were those many years ago. The interiors were still closed to the street, and now and again there was movement behind the latticed windows; that was where the women watched after things. The glare of the sun on the whitewashed stone caused her to avert her eyes. Tangier, so exotic and febrile then, was just another rundown North African seaport, not much coming in, even less going out. In the street nothing moved except dust. The cafés were empty. She stepped into the store on the corner to look at jewelry, bracelets and rings, brightly colored pins. The proprietor rose heavily to his feet and offered to open the case, so many exceptional values at reasonable prices, authentic Moroccan craftsmanship. Please, madame, to try on whatever pleases you. I give you tourist discount. So Annalise bought a bracelet, a souvenir of a Thursday morning in Tangier.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">When she returned to her room at the hotel on the port she found a message from Alec, his voice subdued, long pauses between thoughts. Annalise stood at the open window and watched the boats turn at anchor while she listened to Alec.</p>
<p class="follow">His father had passed away on Tuesday night, an unquiet death. Alec and the nurse were with him but he was not aware of that. His eyes were wide open and filled with terror. He did not speak but raised his hands as if to ward off an intruder. Alec apologized for telling her this but he had no one else to tell it to and felt the need to describe the old man's last minutes. Hours, actually. Whoever said "Do not go gentle into that good night" didn't know what he was talking about. After a long pause, so long that Annalise thought that he had rung off, Alec said that his father made a cry deep in his throat, then he closed his eyes and after a convulsion he died. The nurse was in tears because she was so fond of him. The funeral would be Friday, family only, meaning just him and Mathilde. Mathilde was arriving from London on Thursday. He had tried to get the Senate chaplain to officiate but the chaplain was vacationing in the Ozarks or the Poconos or somewhere and was unavailable, and the task now was to find a clergyman who could say a few words at the grave. Alec had no idea where such a man would be found. He planned a memorial service for the early fall when the Senate resumed session. Music, a dozen or more eulogies.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec went on about plans for the memorial service. Annalise thought he sounded disoriented, his voice unsettled; at the same time his tone was flat, as if he were reading from a prepared text. She continued to watch the boats turn lazily at anchor. A beautiful yacht was moored in the inner harbor, sixty feet long at least, flying an Italian flag aft. A steward, immaculate in white, served drinks in long glasses to three girls sunning themselves on the foredeck. When the girls raised their hands to receive the drinks, their arms curved like swans' necks. The steward carefully placed a long glass in each hand and backed away, a priest at the altar. Annalise remembered a midnight sail from Tangier that began well but ended badly, unpleasantness from one of the older men who had drunk too much and thought he was owed something because it was his boat, his liquor, his hash. Eventually he fell asleep and she and her friend Susanna sailed the yacht back into harbor as dawn broke, the surface of the water a vivid pink. That was when she knew her time was up in Morocco. The parallel universe lost its allure when the sea turned pink. The next day she packed her bags and flew off to Madrid and then Chicago and not long after that to Los Angeles, where her agent had arranged for a car and driver to take her from the airport to the studio, where a contract awaited her signature, Annalise Amiral.</p>
<p class="follow">The old man put up a mighty struggle, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">He didn't want to give it up.</p>
<p class="follow">Did I mention the obituaries? They were respectful, without errors so far as he could tell. All the facts were in order, trees concealing the forest. The obits spoke of the senator as an inside man, more a figure of the cloakroom than of the floor. Friend of presidents, FDR, Truman, JFK, Johnson. LBJ once said that Kim Malone was a better raconteur than he was. Untrue but a generous remark. One of the papers mentioned the bitter 1968 campaign when there were allegations of dirty tricks. The allegations were never proved, though they were widely believed. Alec said, It's disorienting to read an account of your father's public life summed up in a thousand words. They called me for quotes and anecdotes but I couldn't remember a damned thing. My mind went blank. You must have felt the same thing when your father died and you read the notices.</p>
<p class="follow">No kidding, Annalise said aloud.</p>
<p class="follow">She continued to watch the yacht with the Italian flag, much commotion along the rails. A deckhand slipped the anchor chain, the mainsail rose, and the yacht was abruptly under way. Flat on their backs the girls watched the sail billow. They toasted the sail with their long glasses. On the fantail two men played cards and did not give the sail so much as a glance. Annalise watched the boat exit the outer harbor and gather speed, its sails full. It was bound east through the Strait of Gibraltar and then—probably Marbella for a few days before continuing along the Spanish coast and into the Mediterranean, to Capri or wherever the boat was berthed. Well, it could be bound anywhere. Annalise remembered that her father's obit contained a sneaky sentence in which he was described as a most convivial after-hours House colleague. Everyone knew what that meant.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm tired, Alec said finally. I'm tired in my bones. As tired as I've ever been in my life. After the funeral I'm taking a week in Maine, two weeks if I want it. I've rented a house, and the house comes with a boat. Annalise raised her eyebrows at that, watching the Italian yacht bend into the breeze. The men were still playing cards but the girls were watching the water fly by. I'll be out of touch for a while, Alec said. I'll call you in Los Angeles. Thanks for your ear, darling. Then he rang off.</p>
<p class="follow">Annalise watched the yacht a few minutes more, then went to the telephone to call the airline to book her on the first available aircraft to New York via anywhere—Casablanca, Madrid, Paris, London. She'd wait a day to call Alec, to see if he wanted company in Maine. She had no plans and she hadn't been to Maine in years and years. Maine would be the opposite of Morocco.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">The grave was on the downslope of the cemetery, within sight of Rock Creek Parkway. Alec had placed the urn on a green baize cloth and now waited patiently for Mathilde, making small talk with the Baptist minister recruited for the occasion. The day was warm and threatening rain but the Reverend Willis appeared cool and composed in his heavy black suit and shiny white shirt, bow tie. Alec thought it was strange that his father, always surrounded by people, feeding off them, had at this last moment only his son and a stranger. Alec explained that his was a small family. His parents had no brothers or sisters. He was an only child and his daughter was an only child. Such situations often ran in families, a combination of genes and attitude. Mathilde was in her forties but unmarried and likely to remain unmarried. She was extremely attractive and had a fine job with the State Department. She was said to be an able diplomat, good with languages, good with her counterparts. She took the Foreign Service exam and her grandfather saw to it that she would be accepted and receive a good assignment—a clear case of senatorial interference, but it worked out very well all the way around. You couldn't do that today. There'd be a leak to the newspapers and all hell would break loose, a scandal. Mathilde's had, I don't know, three or four serious boyfriends but marriage was never in the cards for her. She told me that once in just those words, but did not explain why, or whatever explanation she gave was not convincing. They were nice boys, too. One was English and the others American. Still, I think she has had good fortune in her life. She's close to her mother, closer than she is to me, but they both live in Europe so that's logical. Mathilde travels a lot for her work, which she loves and is good at. Alec was conscious of talking too much, speaking on automatic pilot, saying whatever came into his head.</p>
<p class="follow">She told me she thought marriage was a kind of trap.</p>
<p class="follow">She liked men but she also liked her own company.</p>
<p class="follow">I suppose she's what you would call a modern woman.</p>
<p class="follow">Do you have children, Reverend Willis?</p>
<p class="follow">I have five children, he said. Boys, he added with a brief smile to indicate that he would say nothing further.</p>
<p class="follow">The Reverend Willis was a middle-aged black man with a stoop, watery eyes, and a sympathetic smile. He listened politely but said little, his reserve suggesting a family retainer whose personal life would remain forever mysterious. Alec said he envied him his boys, always a handful but insurance that his line would continue. Alec's family name would die with him. Hell of a thing, isn't it, a family name disappearing like one of those remote stars that burn up, never to be seen again. Alec reached down to brush leaves from the surface of his mother's gravestone. Many of the nearby graves looked to be untended and unvisited like his mother's. He thought of the cemetery as an enormous battlefield, the dead scattered helter-skelter: he and the Reverend Willis were the only survivors. Black clouds gathered in the west and in a moment the distant shudder of thunder. Alec wished Mathilde would show up. She had left at nine on some errand and promised to meet him at the gravesite at eleven. Now the time was eleven-thirty. Alec said, The name Malone used to mean something in our state but it's mostly forgotten now except in political circles. The local paper gave my father a fine obit with a picture and a two-column headline below the fold on page one. Someone called me yesterday, a condolence call, and said they were surprised that he was being buried here instead of the state. But my father and mother were Washingtonians. They were from the state but they lived here, and Washington was where they wanted to stay. Back home was where the voters were. This was where politics was. Their life was here, you see. They loved Washington, both of them. It's a personal thing. The father of a friend of mine was a ten-term congressman from Illinois. Died too young. But they took him right back to Winnetka for burial. Maybe that's the difference between the Senate and the House.</p>
<p class="follow">I don't know where Mathilde is, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">We'll give her another few minutes if that's all right with you, Reverend.</p>
<p class="follow">The Reverend Willis said of course and looked at his watch. He held his Bible in both hands against his stomach.</p>
<p class="follow">She's often late, Alec said. She gets that from me.</p>
<p class="follow">Will anyone want to speak? the reverend asked.</p>
<p class="follow">I don't, Alec said. I'll ask Mathilde if she wants to.</p>
<p class="follow">I'll only read the one psalm then, the reverend said. If that's all right.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, that's what I want.</p>
<p class="follow">And I will put the urn in the grave and, if you and your daughter wish, you can cover it yourselves. They've provided a shovel.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, that's fine.</p>
<p class="follow">Later on today the cemetery personnel will smooth it over.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, good.</p>
<p class="follow">The Reverend Willis looked over Alec's shoulder and smiled.</p>
<p class="follow">Hello, Alec.</p>
<p class="follow">When he turned he saw Mathilde and Lucia, both dressed in black and carrying bouquets in their arms. Alec had not seen Lucia in years and did not expect to see her now. He had not recognized her voice. Mathilde was wearing a hat and veil; he had never seen her in a hat and thought it added years to her appearance. Lucia put out her hand, he took it, and they shook hands formally, as if they had just then been introduced. She said, I'm sorry, Alec. I know how close you were.</p>
<p class="follow">Mama wanted to come, Mathilde said.</p>
<p class="follow">Well, fine, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">I wanted to say goodbye to him, Lucia said. I remember his funny stories and his hats, the fedora in the fall, winter, and spring, and the straw boater in the summer. His seasonal hats.</p>
<p class="follow">Mathilde kissed her father. She said, We got lost trying to find the grave.</p>
<p class="follow">I hope he had an easy time of it, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">He didn't, Alec said. Then Alec introduced Mathilde and Lucia to the Reverend Willis, and when that was done he said, Let's get started.</p>
<p class="follow">They moved close to the urn and the mound of dirt next to it. Lucia and Mathilde placed their bouquets to either side of the urn, a sudden splash of color. Rain began softly and Lucia opened an umbrella; she and Mathilde stood close together. Alec thought they looked like sisters. The Reverend Willis spoke beautifully and the service was completed in under two minutes. Alec explained about the shovel and they all threw in a ration of dirt. The Reverend Willis said a few more words and wished them Godspeed. Alec handed him an envelope and he moved off slowly through the gravestones to his car, parked somewhere over the hill in Georgetown. The rain eased off, only a few drops now at intervals. Alec stood alone looking at the grave and his mother's headstone next to it. She had had a church service and more than two hundred people were present at the graveside, the Senate chaplain speaking at length, a psalm, a brief eulogy, and another psalm. Halfway through it his father began to cry silently, great tears spilling from his eyes. Alec took one arm and Eliot Bergruen the other and he remembered now that his father seemed to sag, near collapse, and then he gathered himself and pulled the brim of his fedora over his forehead so that no one could see his tears, and he remained with his head down until the chaplain had completed the last psalm and the coffin began its slow descent into the ground, whereupon he looked away, up the hill. God, it was cold that day, snow in the air, everyone in mufflers. The chaplain went on and on about Gawd, Gawd this and Gawd that, Gawd's grace, Gawd's mercy, Gawd everlasting, his plains accent as flat as a drum. The chaplain had the voice of a senator, of a timbre commonly called sonorous but still flat as a drum. After the service the old man went home and poured himself a double Scotch, drank it off, and made another. That was twenty years ago. Alec was suddenly lightheaded and placed his hand on his mother's headstone to steady himself. He closed his eyes, thinking that the service had been too brief. The old man deserved more. But of course in the autumn would come the memorial service, all the ceremony anyone could want.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec?</p>
<p class="follow">He thought of Maine and the boat that went with the house. He reckoned about eleven hours door to door, and he had no reason not to start tonight except he didn't have the energy for an eleven-hour drive. And it would be good to have a quiet meal with Mathilde. At least this was over with and the Baptist had done exactly what he was asked to do, done it correctly and with formality. But what was Lucia doing here? He had no idea she was in the country or knew anything of the old man's death.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec?</p>
<p class="follow">When he raised his eyes he saw the Reverend Willis pause to catch his breath, then resume his slow pace until he was over the hill and lost to view. The moment of vertigo passed but Alec remained with his hand on his mother's headstone, the marble gritty on his fingers. He became aware of the thick silence behind him.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia said, Are you all right, Alec?</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, he said. I'm fine.</p>
<p class="follow">A beautiful service, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">Reverend Willis has a wonderful voice, Mathilde said. I bet if you asked him he would have sung a hymn.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, Alec said. He did very well.</p>
<p class="follow">Where did you find him? Mathilde asked.</p>
<p class="follow">He came recommended, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm sorry we were late, Lucia said. We lost our way—</p>
<p class="follow">It's all right. No harm done. Alec noticed two young men in blue overalls standing under the big oak on the hillside, evidently the Reverend Willis's cemetery personnel preparing to tidy up. There was no reason for him to stay but he was not yet ready to leave. However, he did not wish to witness the tidying up.</p>
<p class="follow">Mama has an idea, Mathilde said. She wants to take us to lunch.</p>
<p class="follow">Only if you want to, Alec.</p>
<p class="follow">The new place on Connecticut Avenue, Mathilde said.</p>
<p class="follow">What place is that? Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">It's quiet, Alec. French.</p>
<p class="follow">French restaurants are never quiet, Alec said.</p>

<p class="follow">This one is, Mathilde said.</p>
<p class="follow">All right, Alec said. Just give me a minute.</p>
<p class="follow">The two women walked off arm in arm and Alec remained. He thought he would say a few last words but no words came to him. He thought that his father had led a fine life, spoiled only marginally by his struggle at the end. Lord knows he did fight and that was a surprise because he was no friend of lost causes. "Show me a lost cause and I'll show you a loser." He won nine terms in the Senate either because of or in spite of his view of lost causes. Alec bowed his head a moment, then looked across to the workers waiting patiently under the big oak. He gave them a signal and they collected their tools and advanced down the hill with their wheelbarrow.</p>
<p class="follow">Mathilde and Lucia were watching him from under the umbrella, causing him to reflect again how much they looked like affectionate sisters, arm in arm, their heads almost touching. They walked away in slow steps up the path. Lucia's limp seemed more pronounced. When they were married Alec found the limp sexy. Her left leg was a mess, long vertical scars, the knee shapeless. That was sexy, too. Looking at her it was easy to imagine her splayed on the mountain, her limbs every which way. Easy to imagine her pain and her helplessness, her ski cap gone, her hair in her eyes and damp from snow. But no such thoughts came to him now.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">The restaurant was not crowded. The maitre d' showed them to a table next to a window in the rear. Alec and Mathilde declined drinks and Lucia ordered a bottle of Sancerre. Mathilde began to talk about the Iraq War and the administration's hostility to diplomacy. Diplomacy was a sign of weakness. Not that diplomacy would solve much; the war was a tragedy brought about by hubris, ignorance, and carelessness. Events were in the saddle. Whirl was king. Perhaps diplomacy was useful at the margins but the consequences of the war would be terrible and affect everyone. These consequences could not be avoided. No one could say this out loud, Mathilde said. To say it was to suggest that nothing could be done and that the situation was hopeless and in the hands of the Fates. The Fates were indifferent. They played no favorites owing to their affinity for chaos. The Republicans were terrible and the Democrats not much better with their platitudes about benchmarks and deadlines. The Fates had no interest in benchmarks and deadlines. So if you are trained as a diplomat, spend your life at it, you feel like a fool. You're wearing white gloves and a flowered hat in a garbage dump. Still, you do what you can. I've had some contact with the Iranians but I'm not allowed to talk about that.</p>
<p class="follow">A zone of silence settled over the table. A light rain fell outside. Neither Alec nor Lucia wanted to discuss the war even though their daughter was, as they heard now, somehow involved. Alec could think of nothing to say to her.</p>
<p class="follow">After a long pause he said, Be careful.</p>
<p class="follow">It's not dangerous, Papa.</p>
<p class="follow">Be careful anyhow, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Listen to your father, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">It's just a thought, Mathilde.</p>
<p class="follow">You're infantilizing me, Mathilde said. I never should have said anything. It's always a mistake with you two.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec was watching a smoker lean against a lamppost and light up. It had been years since he had had a cigarette but he wished he had one now. But society had infantilized cigarette smokers, irresponsible hedonists threatening their own health and the health of others. This smoker seemed content enough despite sharp looks from passersby.</p>
<p class="follow">He said, Where are you living, Lucia?</p>
<p class="follow">We've left Zurich. Nikolas wanted to and I agreed. Now we have a house in Prague and a small apartment in Berlin. But we are spending more and more time in Berlin because the mood in Prague is foul. I suppose the word is "flat." Nikolas believed that Zurich had lost its savor also, and this is why we moved to Prague. I do not think it is wise to move house when you are of a certain age. But it is certainly true that in Prague the oxygen became thin. It was as if we were living high on a mountaintop somewhere. The snap went out of things, do you know what I mean? There is greed and materialism in Prague and it is not good for Nikolas's work. Also, it is not good for sales.</p>
<p class="follow">I can imagine, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Berlin is quite exciting.</p>
<p class="follow">It is?</p>
<p class="follow">Yes. It is avant-garde. Of course there is materialism in Berlin also.</p>
<p class="follow">The one often follows the other, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Did you read Nikolas's last novel, Papa?</p>
<p class="follow">No, I'm afraid not.</p>
<p class="follow">I gave it to you for Christmas, remember?</p>
<p class="follow">Yes. I never got around to it.</p>
<p class="follow">It was very good, Mathilde said. A generational novel set in Poland. The father is an old socialist and his son is an entrepreneur. He imports Japanese wristwatches into Krakow. Makes a fortune. The son bribes people in the government. So there's a natural conflict between the old values and the new.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, I can see that.</p>
<p class="follow">It's a sort of natural history of the new Europe, Mathilde said.</p>
<p class="follow">And about time, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">I don't see why you have to be sarcastic about it, Papa.</p>
<p class="follow">Nikolas wants to come back to Washington, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec looked at her blankly. Why would he want to do that?</p>
<p class="follow">I don't know if I want to but he does. Nikolas says Washington is where the tension is. He thinks America is beyond Rome in its decline, overextended, a debtor nation, its resources exhausted. It no longer controls the capital markets. Nikolas specializes in declining civilizations. He believes that only a European can write successfully of the American situation, its pathos, its inner contradictions, its strife. It's the European who has the authority to make such assessments, given our direct experience of the burden of the previous century. It's history from the point of view of the victims. However, Nikolas rejects the idea that the CIA controls American politics as the KGB controls the Russian. The Russian situation is a different matter entirely, a Slav thing. Nikolas has thought it through, you see. And he believes it's necessary for him to assess the American crisis firsthand. He loves America, actually. He particularly wants to visit Chicago.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec nodded sympathetically while he looked out the window at the middle-aged smoker, who took a last drag and flipped the cigarette Bogart-fashion into the street and strolled off. The sprinkles had ceased, and the sun shined dimly. Alec wondered how you would go about photographing a civilization in decline, choosing the correct subjects and the milieu and how the light fell. Not the whore in the gutter or the banker lighting a cigar with a hundred-dollar bill. What? Beckmann, Kirchner, and Grosz did a beautiful job with Weimar but they were artists. Alec was uncertain how to classify Beckmann's self-portrait in a tuxedo, decadent or not decadent. The face was not a decadent face but the truculent posture showed signs of incipient corruption; and then, thinking it through, Alec decided that the self-portrait revealed a glum satisfaction on the part of the artist and they were of course the same person, another thing surely. Contemporary American artists did not seem much interested in decline. Warhol would be an exception, though Warhol's work always came with a wink. Drawing his swine-faced men and feral gap-toothed women, George Grosz would slit his throat before he'd wink at his subjects or his audience. Winks were not in George Grosz's repertoire or Beckmann's or Kirchner's. Perhaps Bacon or Hockney, but they were British to the spine. Perhaps contemporary artists had too much invested in the decline. They would be ungrateful, perhaps naive, to bite the hands that fed them except in ironic ways that could be disowned later or laughed at. Sincerity was not in their repertoire either. Irony ruled. It would be difficult for them to look at the subject expressively and paint the results with sincerity, meaning savagely or with pity. Of the photographers Alec was even less certain. He himself had never thought of decline as a subject.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia said, Nikolas has concluded that people do not believe in fiction. They do not have the time for it. They are impatient with it. They read fiction as a form of the author's autobiography. He is wondering if a new form must be invented.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec did not hear Lucia. He continued to look out the window at the quiet street and ponder decline. Weegee was dead. Diane Arbus was dead. Alec faltered there. The superb Walker Evans was dead, but Evans was always more interested in resilience than decline. Some of the <em>Vogue</em> photographers would qualify, all those dark portraits of louche women in dishabille. Fashion photography generally offered splendid opportunities but the results did not approach Beckmann, Kirchner, and Grosz, and Otto Dix also, even Man Ray and his sleek-bodied blank-faced nudes. "Decline" would not be the word for Steichen or Karsh. Alec reflected that decline had never much figured in his own work and wondered if his long-ago missed opportunity to photograph Vietnam was the reason, or anyway one reason, since there was always more than one reason for choosing one project instead of another. He certainly had plenty of time on his hands if he wanted to take it up now, although there was every possibility that through-thinking Nikolas was correct that only a European could do the subject justice owing to direct experience of the horrors of the previous century. Alec watched a cat slink from the alley next door and scoot across the street, tail high.</p>
<p class="follow">He's in a reverie again, Mathilde said.</p>
<p class="follow">He never changes, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">The first time I noticed I was five, six years old.</p>
<p class="follow">Reminds me of the old days, too.</p>

<p class="follow">It's weird. But no harm done.</p>
<p class="follow">No, I never thought it was harmful.</p>
<p class="follow">Disconcerting?</p>
<p class="follow">Most disconcerting, Lucia said. Whenever I asked him where he was when he went away like that, I always got a false answer.</p>
<p class="follow">How did you know it was false, Mama?</p>
<p class="follow">I don't know. I knew.</p>
<p class="follow">The waiter arrived with the wine and made a show of pulling the cork and pouring a splash for Alec, who looked up with a start. He nodded at Lucia; hers to taste. Lucia sipped, said the wine was fine, and in a moment the three glasses were full and the wine bottle was in its bucket. They listened while the waiter recited the specials of the day, then stood with his pad, pencil poised. We will order in ten minutes, Lucia said, and the waiter went away.</p>
<p class="follow">What were you thinking of, Alec?</p>
<p class="follow">When?</p>
<p class="follow">Just now, looking out the window.</p>
<p class="follow">I was watching a smoker and thinking how much I'd enjoy a cigarette about now.</p>
<p class="follow">You haven't smoked in years, Mathilde said.</p>
<p class="follow">That's why, Alec replied.</p>
<p class="follow">Anyway, Lucia said with a smile, that's enough about Nikolas.</p>
<p class="follow">Perspective, Mathilde said. The European angle of vision.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm sure he's on to something there, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Nikolas is exceptionally hard-working, Mathilde said.</p>
<p class="follow">That's what it takes all right.</p>
<p class="follow">He's published twenty books, Mathilde said.</p>
<p class="follow">Say a prayer for the forests of Canada, Alec said. He swallowed some wine and said to Lucia, Does your leg still give you trouble?</p>
<p class="follow">No more than usual. They want to do another operation since the first one was botched, they say. I don't know about it, though. I don't know if it's worth it at my age. But they tell me I'll be able to ski again without it hurting all the time.</p>
<p class="follow">That's something, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Not enough, Lucia said. But thank you for asking.</p>
<p class="follow">I noticed your limp, he said. It seemed a little worse.</p>
<p class="follow">I go back and forth on the operation. One day I think I'll do it, next day I won't. Today is one of the won't days. Tomorrow I'll say what a great thing it would be to ski again without it hurting all the time. What do you think?</p>
<p class="follow">I don't know, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">No, really. Nikolas is against it.</p>
<p class="follow">I never liked any sport well enough to get cut for it.</p>
<p class="follow">Sailing?</p>
<p class="follow">You don't need to get cut to sail. Anybody can sail.</p>
<p class="follow">So you still do.</p>
<p class="follow">Not much, he said, neglecting to add that he did not see well enough to sail. Bad enough driving a car. Alec imagined closing his good eye during a regatta and seeing half a dozen Munchboats coming at him and commencing a reverie about the Norwegian forests and piling into a pier.</p>
<p class="follow">Why are you smiling, Alec?</p>
<p class="follow">I like the wine, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">If I may ask. What are you going to do now?</p>
<p class="follow">Nothing new. What I've always done.</p>
<p class="follow">No trips?</p>
<p class="follow">I'm leaving for Maine tomorrow.</p>
<p class="follow">An assignment?</p>
<p class="follow">No. There are fewer and fewer of those each year. I get older, the magazines downsize or go out of business. I mostly photograph for my own pleasure.</p>
<p class="follow">You always did, Alec.</p>
<p class="follow">Not always, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">Mathilde drove me by your house this morning. It hasn't changed much, at least from the outside. The dry cleaner is still on the corner. The Alhambra's the same, too, at least the facade is. Lucia turned to Mathilde and remarked that the house was much smaller than she remembered it. Alec ceased to listen because of the commotion at a table in the corner of the room, the one that promised privacy. A very old man was struggling to his feet assisted by a gray-haired woman and the waiter. Upright at last, he swayed a moment then ambled from the restaurant, much stooped, the woman at his side. He turned at the door and Alec got a clear look at him, the secretary of defense of so long ago. Alec remembered Lucia's mischievous wave and the secretary's answering smile. It was said that when he departed from his post at last, neither he nor Lyndon Johnson could say for certain whether he had resigned or was fired. Kim Malone called it a true Washington whodunit. Those years were laden with mysteries.</p>
<p class="follow">Then the waiter was at their table with omelets for Lucia and Mathilde and steak-frites for Alec. Alec asked the waiter for a glass of red Bordeaux and listened to Lucia and Mathilde talk about the changes in Georgetown, fancier cars on the street, showier people on the sidewalk. And the dress shop on Wisconsin Avenue, still there, Alec. Where I bought my dress for the party at the d'Ans', the first time we were invited. I was so excited.</p>
<p class="follow">Where was I? Mathilde asked.</p>
<p class="follow">Not born, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">She was too. I remember the babysitter.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, the nosy Russian woman, Mathilde said.</p>
<p class="follow">She was observant, Alec said. Through the window he watched the former secretary of defense cross the street, walking arm in arm with the gray-haired woman. Alec wondered if he thought often of those days when he was a prince of the city; now he was a former prince with a mournful countenance. Alec said, Where are you staying, Lucia?</p>
<p class="follow">Who is that man in the street, Alec?</p>
<p class="follow">Nobody you know, Alec said.</p>

<p class="follow">Lucia shrugged. I'm staying with Gretta. She lives at the Watergate. Since Charlie died. I couldn't be more surprised. I thought she'd return to Sweden where her family is. I've visited her several times over the years. Gretta's a different person in Sweden. Of course—a bright laugh from Lucia—she's older now and not so much of a hell-raiser. She did love Swedish men. She said that once she came to know Washington she liked it. Gretta always took a month each year in Sweden, though. You were a puzzle to her, Alec.</p>
<p class="follow">I was?</p>
<p class="follow">Yes.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec did not inquire further. He bent to his steak-frites, perfectly cooked. The meal could only be better with a glass of red wine, which at that moment arrived in the hand of the waiter. Lucia and Mathilde began to talk about the State Department. Mathilde said she was afraid she had made a religion of work. She worked all the time. She had no social life to speak of. Of course she enjoyed the work, otherwise she wouldn't do it, but she had the feeling also that she was missing out. Because she was unmarried and footloose they gave her traveling assignments. She loved the pace and the variety. She was good at what she did. She knew there was a reward at the end of the line, a small embassy somewhere, she hoped not too small. Not Africa, unless it was North Africa or South Africa. Probably she was too old for a family but she wouldn't mind a permanent man in her life, and he would have to be a very special character to put up with her odd hours and traveling. Whoever he was, she hadn't met him yet. Mathilde lowered her voice, speaking directly to her mother, Lucia nodding in agreement with whatever her daughter was telling her. Something in Mathilde's tone and bearing reminded Alec of his father. He saw Mathilde touch her mother's elbow, something his father habitually did when he had a secret to impart. But all she said was something about her fitness routine, a long jog in the morning, the gym whenever she could fit it in. That made Alec smile, thinking of Mathilde and her grandfather. She had no idea how much she owed the old man.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec?</p>
<p class="follow">He would never again make the trip to the hospital as he had done once or twice a week for five years. He would never again visit the cemetery with the effigy of the Confederate infantryman, young Timothy Smith. The journey had become the organizing principle of his life and now it was gone. In a few days he would be in Maine and in a few weeks back in Washington, unless he and Annalise went somewhere. His calendar was blank. He wouldn't mind a vacation abroad if Annalise would go with him. He didn't feel like working, though. Alec decided that when they finished lunch he would walk back to Rock Creek Park and stop at his father's grave, say whatever words came to him. He was suddenly very tired. His arms felt as heavy as anvils. He had barely touched his wine.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec looked up when Lucia said something to him.</p>
<p class="follow">I wonder if I can ask you a favor, Alec.</p>
<p class="follow">If I can, he said. Depending. He tried to keep his voice free of suspicion but suspected that he failed.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia gave a little pro forma laugh and said she had a confession. She had not come to Washington for Kim Malone's funeral. She had arrived three days ago on another mission altogether. Most unexpected, most unsettling.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">My father is here, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Living in Washington, Mathilde said.</p>
<p class="follow">Where is he living? Alec asked.</p>
<p class="follow">It's a kind of retirement home, Lucia said. Way out northwest.</p>
<p class="follow">He sent word to Mama, Mathilde said. He wants to see her.</p>
<p class="follow">I have no idea how he knew my address, Lucia said. I mean where Nikolas and I live in Prague. The letter came out of the blue, unfamiliar handwriting. I can't imagine why he's here of all places. My father never had anything to do with Americans or Washington. All these years I've believed he was dead. My mother assured me. She was quite positive about it. Lucia poured some Sancerre into her glass, her hand trembling when she brought the glass to her mouth and swallowed. She looked bleakly at Mathilde. The pale light of the afternoon sun touched her face in such a way as to highlight the freckles that had faded with age. Quite suddenly she looked years older. If Alec had passed her on the street he would not have recognized her.</p>
<p class="follow">Mama's upset, Mathilde said.</p>
<p class="follow">How do you want me to help, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">I want you to go with me when I meet him.</p>
<p class="follow">Please, Papa, Mathilde said.</p>
<p class="follow">I don't want to see him but I feel I must, Lucia said. His letter was courteous but abrupt. He said he wanted to see me and that I could come any time, he wasn't going anywhere. He gave me his address and a telephone number and said he would expect my call. All these years, now this, out of the blue. I don't know what he wants of me but he wants something. Money, a reconciliation, a jolly chat about how cute I was when I was three years old. That was the last time we saw each other. I don't know what he looks like. I don't know what he'll say or do.</p>
<p class="follow">It's important, Papa.</p>
<p class="follow">He's very old, you know. He and my mother married when they were teenagers. Or he was a teenager. My mother was a little older. My father has been missing for—I suppose it's near seventy years. I have no idea how he's lived or where. I have no idea what this is about or why he's here of all places. But when I got his letter I had to come. Nikolas was against it.</p>
<p class="follow">Why was that? Alec asked.</p>
<p class="follow">He didn't see what could be gained. But the point isn't gaining or losing. The point is getting it over with. I have no idea what sort of home it is. I have an address and a telephone number. That's all. I know it's a lot to ask of you today.</p>

<p class="follow">Please, Papa, Mathilde said.</p>
<p class="follow">All right, Alec said. When do you want to do this?</p>
<p class="follow">I want to do it now, this afternoon.</p>
<p class="follow">Now? He thought of his father, the visit he had planned, the words he intended to say at the old man's grave.</p>
<p class="follow">I don't want to wait. I want to get it over with.</p>
<p class="follow">Surely you understand, Papa.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec looked over Lucia's shoulder to the street outside, deserted, no pedestrians, no traffic. The washed-out sun cast no shadows. Alec thought the street as blank as the pages in his calendar, the current page and all the pages that came after. He had much to look forward to because the long-nosed man had come and gone. He had no obligations, nothing to detain him. Still, the city looked as if it had gone into hibernation. Alec took a swallow of wine and his great weariness seemed to lift. He had always been curious about Andre Duran, the ghost at Lucia's elbow. Alec was aware of the silence at the table. He gave Lucia a considered look and said at last, All right. I'll go with you.</p>
<p class="follow">The waiter arrived with the bill and Lucia put a credit card on it without looking at the total. When the waiter went away she put her hand on Alec's and left it there. She said, I don't know anything about him. I don't know what he wants. I feel I need protection.</p>
