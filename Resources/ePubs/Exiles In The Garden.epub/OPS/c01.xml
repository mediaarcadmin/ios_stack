<h1 class="chaptertitle">THE PHOTOGRAPHER</h1>
<p class="left"><b>E</b><span style="font-size: smaller">SPECIALLY</span> when he was alone Alec Malone had the habit of slipping into reverie, a semiconscious state not to be confused with dreams. Dreams were commonplace while his reveries presented a kind of abstract grandeur, expressionist canvases in close focus, untitled. That was how he thought of them, and not only because of the score in the background, German music, voices, trumpets, metronomic bass drums, and now and again the suggestion of a tango or a march. The reveries had been with him since childhood and he treated them like old friends paying a visit. The friends aged as he did, becoming increasingly abstract now that he had begun to lose sight in his right eye, a hole in the macula that began as a pinprick but was now the size of an <em>o.</em> That eye saw only the periphery of things with any clarity. The condition was annoying, not disabling, since sight was a function not of one eye but of two and Alec's left eye was sound. However, driving at night was an adventure. He did not permit himself to drive in fog because objects had a way of vanishing altogether. And there was some amusement—when he closed his left eye and looked at a human face with his right, that face appeared as an expressionist's death's-head, an image very like Munch's <em>The Scream.</em></p>
<p class="follow">Alec had the usual habits of one who lived alone: a fixed diet, a weekly visit to the bookstore, a scrupulously balanced checkbook, and a devotion to major league baseball and the PGA Tour. He worked when he felt like it. He described himself to himself as leading a chamber-music sort of life except for the Wagnerian reveries. They were neutral fantasies, meaning they had nothing to do with the life he wished he had led—Alec was quite content with the one he had—or might lead in the future. He did not count himself a prophet. He returned often to his childhood but rarely lingered there. His childhood was so long ago that the events he remembered most vividly seemed to him to have happened to someone else and were incomplete in any case, washed-out colors side by side with ink-black holes, a half-remembered country governed by a grim-faced man with a long nose, a figure from antiquity, perhaps a <em>bildnis</em> from Durer's sketchbook. Alec considered the long-nosed man a family heirloom, grandmother's silver or the pendulum clock on the mantel, the one whose ticks and tocks sounded like pistol reports. He lost his footing in those early years in which the domestic life of his own family was usurped by the civic life of the nation. That was the life that counted. The Malone dinner table, his father presiding, was a combination quiz show and news conference.</p>
<p class="follow">Quick now, Alec. How many congressional districts in Iowa? Which nations were signatories to the Locarno Pact? Who wrote "Fear of serious injury cannot alone justify suppression of free speech and assembly. Men feared witches and burned women. It is the function of speech to free men from the bondage of irrational fears"?</p>
<p class="follow">What was Glass-Steagall? Who was Colonel House?</p>

<p class="follow">Where is Yalta?</p>
<p class="follow">Question: What's the difference between ignorance and indifference?</p>
<p class="follow">Answer: I don't know and I don't care.</p>
<p class="follow">Hush, Alec. Don't disturb your father when he's talking to Mr. Roosevelt. Don't you know there's a war on?</p>
<p class="follow">À la recherche du temps Roosevelt. The president inhabited the house in Chevy Chase like a member of the family or a living god, present everywhere and visible nowhere. Alec's father called him the Boss. The Boss wants this, the Boss wants that. The Boss sounded a little tired today but he's leaving for Warm Springs tomorrow. In his reveries Alec conjured the president in his White House office, talking into the telephone in his marbled Hudson River voice, commanding an entire nation—its armies, its factories and farms, all its citizens great and small. Yet Alec had no sense of him as a man—not then, not later—and when he tentatively asked his father, the reply was bromidic. He was great. He was the greatest man his father had ever met, and he had met many, many of the highest men in the land, shaken their hands, spoken tête-à-tête, worked with them, worked against them. The Boss was different. The Boss lived on a different level, deriving his strength and his courage from—and here his father faltered, uncomfortable always in the realm of the mystical. Finally he said, His legs are useless, you know. He can hardly walk. But he likes a martini at the end of the day just like the rest of us, and there the comparison ends. Alec, I'd say he's Shakespearean. That's the best I can do.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec nodded, wondering all the while which of Shakespeare's kings his father had in mind—Macbeth, Richard III, Coriolanus? Henry V, no doubt, though that comparison did not seem apt. Shakespeare's kings suffered the consequences of their will to power. The will to power was the evil in them, not that they did not have ample assistance from others—wives, false friends, rivals, the Fates. When the president died Alec's father was inconsolable. Washington was suddenly a darker, lesser place. Then he was summoned by Harry Truman—they had never gotten along—who extended his hand and asked for help, not an easy thing for him to do. Mr. Truman was a prideful man, often vindictive. Of course Senator Malone agreed to do whatever Mr. Truman wanted done. There was a war on. Each man did his part willingly. But it wasn't the same.</p>
<p class="follow">For years Franklin D. Roosevelt figured in Alec's reveries but eventually faded as Alec drifted upward, forward to his young manhood and early middle age and beyond, what he considered his meridian years—when he was out of his father's house, out of his orbit, out from under, married to Lucia Duran and working in what his father dismissively called "snapshots" but which everyone else called photography. His father wanted his boy to follow him into politics, commencing a dynasty; state attorney general, his father thought, then governor, and after that anything was possible. The Boss had been a governor.</p>
<p class="follow">No, Alec told his father.</p>
<p class="follow">But—why ever not?</p>
<p class="follow">I don't believe in dynasties, Alec said, which was the truth but not the salient truth. The salient truth was that the civic life of the nation held no attraction. He preferred Shakespeare's life to the life of any one of his kings or pretenders, tormented men always grasping for that thing just out of reach. Deluded men. Men adrift on a sea of troubles, some of their own making, some not. In any case, the Fates were in charge, part of the human equation along with ambition and restlessness. Alec was satisfied with his photography and his reveries, including the mundane, the look of ordinary things and the time of day, what the weather was like outside and who was present at the occasion, a cat slumbering in a splash of bright sunlight, red and yellow roses proliferating. Life's excitement lay just outside the frame of reference, grandeur felt but not seen yet grandeur all the same. Alec's reveries were his way of bringing life down to earth, so to speak.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">It is reliably reported that the people of Milan, where Verdi lay dying in the winter of 1901, put sheaves of straw in the street outside his hotel to deaden the sound of horses' hooves so that the great composer might have peace in his last days. Alec liked to believe that Verdi was composing a melody up to the end, another opera or requiem, surprised that his street was so quiet; annoyed, perhaps, because he was accustomed to commotion, shouts, arguments, even a burst of song. Alec imagined the residents of the neighborhood laying straw before dawn, even the children. Verdi honored the Milanese by choosing the hotel and they would repay the honor. If God granted him another month he would give them one last opera, but if that was not God's plan, then at least the maestro would have silence. That was the least they could do. Verdi had given them much pleasure, many occasions for laughter and tears, cries of Bravo! And his own life had been marked by terrible tragedy, his wife and young children dying within a few years of one another. Verdi found happiness and repose in his music. The <em>Requiem</em> alone was sufficient for any man's creative life on this earth.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec was thinking of the musician Verdi because his thoughts had turned once again to his father, slipping away at last at a private hospital in the Virginia countryside. His father was a composer of sorts, a maestro in his own way. He would describe himself as a composer of laws. A law needed allegro here, adagio there; no crescendo if it could be avoided. Legislation was ensemble work. Soloists had their place, but the ensemble came first. The ensemble enabled the soloist. He had been a senator for nine terms, fifty-four years, retired now for a decade and still alert on good days. The old man was well content at Briarwoods, with its cheerful staff, well-stocked library, four-page wine list, and relaxed attitude generally.</p>
<p class="follow">The hospital was situated atop a low rise approached by a road that worked through farmland and hardwood forest and stands of cherry trees in furious bloom this April afternoon. The mansions and outbuildings of gentleman farmers, their barns and stables, tennis courts and swimming pools, were well off the main road and were not visible except for a chimney or flagpole. Horses moved about in fields bounded by whitewashed fences. A mile or so from the hospital a small cemetery enclosed by an iron fence appeared suddenly and Alec pulled off the road to look at it, as he often did when the light was good. The grounds were deserted, as they often were. Here and there flowers were placed next to gravestones, causing him to wonder if survivors arrived at night or early in the morning, paying their respects in a private fashion. Confederate dead from Second Bull Run were buried there along with local residents. At the far corner a statue of an infantryman, eyes north, his Sharps rifle at port arms, stood guard. From that distance the infantryman's attitude was one of truculence but up close his face was blank, unreadable below the visor of his forage cap. He was a muscular young man, his forearms balancing the Sharps as if it had the weight of a feather. His name was Timothy Smith, no rank or unit, his dates given as 1845-1863. <em>Beloved son of Andrew and Constance Smith.</em></p>
<p class="follow">Alec focused and shot two pictures but he thought the light was not correct and lowered his camera. He wondered if the Smith family still lived in the region. Probably not; there was no sign that anyone had ever visited the boy's grave. And then he saw a spent cartridge, twelve-gauge from the look of it. Someone had used the boy's statue as a blind for bird-shooting. Far away Alec heard the rat-a-tat-tat of a woodpecker. He stood for a few minutes more, looking at the cartridge and listening to the bird but thinking again of his father and wondering if he contemplated a statue as a gravestone, the old man standing at his desk on the Senate floor, his hand raised, an accusing finger pointing skyward, an image from the nineteenth century, Daniel Webster or Henry Clay denouncing perfidy—but no, his father rarely rose on the Senate floor except to deliver an encomium to his state and its many sound-minded hard-working God-fearing citizens. He was a cloakroom man, his arm around someone's shoulder, a whispered confidence, a promise, often a threat. Ensemble work, hard to capture successfully in limestone or marble—though <em>Time</em> magazine once published a profile titled "The Violinist" with an inspired cartoon of the Senate as an orchestra, Senator Malone the concertmaster whose bow was attached by threads to all the instruments of the ensemble, the old man smiling benignly as he sawed away. Alec could see in his mind's eye the words on the plinth: <em>Erwin Harold "Kim" Malone, 1905-200-, United States Senator.</em> The old man had been called Erwin until he was five, when his mother became enthralled by Kipling's daring lad. She began to call her son Kim, and the name stuck.</p>
<p class="follow">The hospital's slate roof was visible beyond the cemetery. Alec thought it tactless to build a hospital so close to a graveyard. Old people were superstitious. But while the hospital was visible from the graveyard, the graveyard was not visible from the hospital. The old man's doctor made the point quite forcibly. The architects knew what they were doing. They promised a secure and cheerful environment and that is what they delivered. Rest assured, Mr. Malone. The view from your father's window will be pastoral, a comforting vista for him to contemplate in his last days, however many there are. Alec squeezed off one last shot of the Confederate sharpshooter and returned to his car for the short drive to Briarwoods, private road, no trespassing. He had been making this journey once, often twice a week for five years. Each time his father had something new to say, but his words came less confidently and there were long minutes when he did not speak at all. Alec had come to realize that his father was an erratic narrator of his own life. But that was mostly a consequence of the life he had led, a leader of the Senate ensemble. There were so many violins that it was sometimes hard to identify your own; the music was dissonant and naturally there were occasions you preferred to forget on grounds that one bad apple must never be allowed to spoil the barrel. Alec believed that life was, for the most part, involuntary.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">From his wide bow window the old man could see the sixteenth hole of his old golf club, the long undulating fairway and the tiny green guarded by bunkers, one bunker so deep that when a player stepped into it he disappeared and when he struck the ball you saw only a great fan of sand, the ball rising from it as fragile-seeming as an eggshell, and it landed softly as cotton. The course was championship caliber and its members mostly scratch players, a different environment entirely from the years when the old man belonged and played on weekends. The course was easy then and only a few members played to a handicap of less than twenty. A scratch handicap meant that a man was not tending to business. He neglected his homework. He was not a serious man. Instead, he was a sport. With the exception of a few doctors the membership had always been political, members of Congress and their senior assistants, cabinet secretaries and their deputies, White House staff. Ambassadors were welcome if they called ahead. A quarter of the membership were lawyers or lobbyists. Kim Malone was puzzled by this new environment, so frivolous and so self-important at the same time. Where did they come from, these new members? Where did they find the time to hone their games to such perfection, booming drives and crisp iron play, twenty-five-foot putts rolled true. They worked out. They spent hours on the practice range, whole mornings with a five-iron. They played golf like professionals, even the women. And now and then when he looked from his second-floor window he saw a familiar face from the PGA Tour playing in a high-rolling foursome, hundred-dollar Nassaus and sometimes much more. Washington had always been a gambler's town, football, horseracing, backgammon, stud poker, golf.</p>
<p class="follow">My God, Alec, we wouldn't've been caught dead playing with Snead or Sarazen. They were too good for us. We'd've been embarrassed by our play. We were weekend duffers. And they would not have understood our conversation, always politics and government, the merits of a judicial nomination or the conference report on the minimum wage or the little river project the majority leader had tucked away in the supplemental appropriation for the army. Also, we spoke of confidential personal matters that even a golf professional could understand and take back to the locker room at Shinnecock or Medinah, and that talk was none of his business. When I played here years ago that bunker the size of a strip mine looked like a little kid's sandbox and even then it took us three, four shots to get up and down. The other day I looked out my window and saw the usual three lobby boys from <span style="font-size: smaller">AIPAC</span>, guns, and motion pictures, with a newspaper reporter. Can you believe it? All four beautifully turned out, creases in their trousers, shoes shined, straw hats. They never spoke a word, those four, concentrating on their shots. Newsman laid one up three feet from the pin from two hundred yards out, beautiful shot, just superb. My day, no newsman played golf. They couldn't afford it and no club would have them if they could afford it. Eisenhower played golf. Newsmen bowled, like old Cactus Jack Garner. Or they played handball at the Y. Maybe one or two of them played tennis. Wasn't tennis Adlai's game?</p>
<p class="follow">They probably learned golf at Princeton, where they all go to school now because their daddies are rich.</p>
<p class="follow">Come to think of it, Adlai went to Princeton.</p>
<p class="follow">Newsmen go to Harvard.</p>
<p class="follow">It's the presidents who go to Yale.</p>
<p class="follow">Where did you go to school, Alec?</p>
<p class="follow">Two years at the university. And then I went to work.</p>
<p class="follow">What did you do?</p>

<p class="follow">You remember, Alec said. Snapshots.</p>
<p class="follow">I was always sorry you didn't go to work in politics.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm not good at politics.</p>
<p class="follow">You aren't?</p>
<p class="follow">No, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">I always thought you were.</p>
<p class="follow">Often in the past when Alec came to visit, the old man was watching the play with a friend who occupied the adjoining suite. Listening to them was like hearing one of Harold Pinter's wayward domestic dramas. Eliot Bergruen was a lawyer who had been in and out of government for fifty years but whose memory had stopped somewhere in the 1930s when he had been minority counsel to the Senate Finance Committee. He had gone on to become one of the capital's most successful lawyers, rarely the lawyer of record but essential at the table, saying little until called upon to sum up, which he did with scrupulous accuracy. Exactitude, he called it. Someone was in trouble with one of the federal agencies or commissions or the Justice Department itself; someone was on a hook and Eliot got them off the hook or made the hook disappear or turned the hook into a ladder. But of those years he had no memory at all. Neither did he remember his own name or the names of his children. He did not remember his wife, dead now many years. He did remember to address Alec's father as Senator, though for half of the previous century he had called him Kim. They had collaborated on numerous projects, reaching across the aisle, as it were. Collaboration was the essence of the legislative craft, half a loaf a kind of sacred grail or golden mean.</p>
<p class="follow">Eliot Bergruen and Kim Malone knew so much and had forgotten so much that younger men, seeing them years ago tête-à-tête at their downtown club, called their corner table the Graveyard. Eavesdropping was useless because their gossip was decades old and the names and situations were unfamiliar. Muscle Shoals, Trygve Lie, Warren Magnuson, Clayton Fritchey. Eliot had only a few tricks up his sleeve now and they were well thumbed, not always to the point. Occasionally he came up with a startling fact. Watching golf in the senator's room one afternoon Eliot remarked that Herbert Hoover was an eighth cousin once removed of Richard Nixon. Moreover, Lou Hoover was the greatest of all the first ladies, dignified and witty at the same time, well read, a radiant smile, nice legs, certainly a damn sight better than the harridan who followed her and the nonentities who followed the harridan, though he could not at this precise moment recall their names.</p>
<p class="follow">We've seen the best of it, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">What was the harridan's name?</p>
<p class="follow">Eleanor, Alec's father said.</p>
<p class="follow">That's the one, Eliot said. That voice! Those shoes!</p>
<p class="follow">She had a beautiful voice, Alec's father said. She was a beautiful woman.</p>
<p class="follow">No, Senator. She was not.</p>
<p class="follow">Bore a passing resemblance to Garbo.</p>
<p class="follow">Who's Garbo? Eliot asked.</p>
<p class="follow">Never mind, he added. I know. Senator from Mississippi.</p>
<p class="follow">That was Bilbo, Kim Malone said.</p>
<p class="follow">One of yours, Eliot said.</p>
<p class="follow">My side of the aisle, yes.</p>
<p class="follow">Dumb as a post.</p>
<p class="follow">That was the least of his failings, Kim Malone said.</p>
<p class="follow">They had been great friends and collaborators, though on the opposite side of things politically. With the advent of the Eisenhower administration—eight green years after twenty of drought—Eliot Bergruen prospered and continued to prosper until well into the second term of the Clintons, by which time both he and Kim Malone were museum pieces. They retired to the private hospital within weeks of each other in the summer of 2003. Eventually the old lawyer stopped speaking altogether. His family no longer visited him. His firm dropped his name from its letterhead. But Alec's father continued to insist that Eliot be brought in to watch the golf, the spray of sand that announced the shot, the derisory laughter that drifted up from the sixteenth green. Kim kept up a running commentary but Eliot did not notice. His gaze was fixed on the heavy clouds approaching from the west and the cherry trees that lined the fairway, their petals scattering in the breeze. Eliot did not speak and it was impossible to know what he gathered or if he gathered anything, the look on his face as faraway as witty Lou Hoover's. Still, Kim Malone enjoyed having him in and was always sorry when the nurse arrived to wheel Eliot back to his own room.</p>
<p class="follow">So long, see you tomorrow. Sleep well.</p>
<p class="follow">Yup.</p>
<p class="follow">When Eliot Bergruen died, Alec's father began to lose himself, concerned now only with his own unraveling condition. He insisted that he had ceased to see himself as a human being, hence his confusion, bad temper, idleness, and shabby appearance. He allowed himself to go to seed, allowed his hair and fingernails to grow like a corpse in the grave. He thought of himself now as a laboratory specimen confined to a bedlam-kennel supervised by indifferent technicians, careless vivisectionists. The vivisectionists wore half-glasses and cultivated an air of vulgar disdain. They were the sentinels of the modern world come to carry him off. They answered to no one. They were beyond the reach of any human authority. Alec's father stated that he was no longer in a situation of becoming. He was slipping backward, neither here nor there. He no longer had standing.</p>
<p class="follow">He said, I live in the calm of the horse latitudes. I am from the land of lost content.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec thought his father said "lost contentment."</p>
<p class="follow">No. Lost <em>content.</em> Nothing there.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, Alec said. I understand.</p>
<p class="follow">No, you don't. But you will.</p>
<p class="follow">Do these vivisectionists have names?</p>
<p class="follow">I know who they are, the old man said.</p>
<p class="follow">Thin-faced? Long-nosed?</p>
<p class="follow">They are my enemies, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">But you've outlived your enemies. All your enemies are dead.</p>
<p class="follow">Not to me they're not. Wherever I'm going, they're waiting for me, each one with a score to settle. The residue of seventy years of public life. I'm outnumbered. They're crowding me. I've lost my immunity. Things were better when Eliot was alive. Eliot could back them off, did so on a number of occasions. Oh, he was good. He had no use for the law, you know. Didn't own a law book. Eliot knew human nature backwards and forwards and that was his great secret. The old man paused at that, frowning and moving his shoulders. I do so wish now I'd gone to his funeral.</p>
<p class="follow">Why didn't you?</p>
<p class="follow">I don't know, the old man said carelessly. Maybe I overslept. The vivisectionists were present. However, I was told it was a grand occasion, three members of the cabinet, the British ambassador, because the British have long memories and knew that Eliot had worked for Lend-Lease. Enough lawyers and lobbyists to fill San Quentin. The vice president gave the eulogy. All Eliot's women were there, or those who are still alive. They filled the rear pew of the church and all of them were smiling through tears, according to my informant.</p>
<p class="follow">His women?</p>
<p class="follow">Eliot had a rough-and-tumble love life. A fact that went unremarked by our I-don't-know-and-I-don't-care vice president, who preferred to concentrate on his services to the party. Eliot was quite a fine piece of work. And what I want to know is, where did he find the time?</p>
<p class="follow">
<em>Eliot?</em>
</p>
<p class="follow">Women loved him. That elfin look, his boutonniere, his habit of sending flowers, and inside the vase along with the flowers a little blue box from Tiffany's. He was a beautiful dancer, you know. The waltz, the tango. When he danced he was light on his feet. And he always had his hand up some woman's skirt. The old man made a gesture with his hands as if he were shooing away insects, and then he laughed. He said, Besides the elfin look and the dancing he had a cynical outlook on life that appealed to women. Eliot maintained that most Washington women were cynics. That was because they knew their men intimately. What was said at night in the darkness as opposed to what was said at the televised news conference or on the Senate floor. For God's sake be the man I married instead of the man I almost didn't marry. Words of that kind from the wife to the husband. Personally I never found that to be true, the cynicism of women. But that was what Eliot said, and he ought to know. I mostly spent my time in the company of men.</p>
<p class="follow">I'll be damned, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">You didn't know that? I thought everyone knew, common knowledge. He loved chasing women and he loved the Republican Party. I don't know in which order. Maybe they came in no particular order, merely situational. Republicans in the daylight, women after hours. The old man sighed and when he spoke again his voice was pale, losing timbre with each word. He said, Eliot got started with women during the Second World War when he was working for Lend-Lease. Washington, so gray during the Depression, was a wide-open town during the war, everyone working dawn to dusk and loving it. That was the first time in memory that we had a government that everyone looked to, even Republicans, much as they despised Franklin. Most of the men were away in the service. Their wives and girlfriends stayed home and went to work at places like OSS and the War Department and found that they liked it. They were women who were attracted to masculine atmospheres, high stress, sometimes profane, wisecracking, footloose. Also, the wages were good. I think it came as a surprise to women, how much they liked the work and how good they were at it. At any event, Eliot was Four-F owing to a bad heart. So he stayed home, too, dancing the nights away. And he lived to a hundred and three. My oldest friend.</p><p class="follow">I didn't go to the funeral because I didn't want to hear the eulogy, the old man added. I hate that p-prick.</p>
<p class="follow">Politics trumps friendship.</p>
<p class="follow">Eliot would have understood. Daylight rules.</p>
<p class="follow">The old man smiled wanly as the half-light of afternoon began to fail, the room growing dark. He mumbled something that Alec didn't hear, all the while scratching at his wrist. His skin was paper-thin and began to bleed. Alec took his father's hand but the old man was tremendously strong and continued to flay his wrist. At last this unexpected burst of energy began to ebb and he lay still. Alec felt in his pocket for the Leica, the beautiful machine he had owned for more than forty years, a birthday present from his father. It did not seem correct to turn it against him now, and Alec did not favor catching subjects unawares, their attention elsewhere. This seemed to him an invasion of privacy. The truth was, he preferred stationary objects, the Confederate infantryman or a garden at dusk.</p>
<p class="follow">I hope you don't hold it against me, that argument we had.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec smiled. Which one?</p>
<p class="follow">You know darn well which one.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, of course.</p>
<p class="follow">I was out of bounds, the old man said. I admit it. But my God, son, you were a mystery to me. You were an enigma. Enigmas trouble me.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec had it now. That was the argument that had its origins at Arlington Cemetery—as it happened, the first time he had used the Leica professionally. A military funeral, a bright day in December, one of the World War Two generals laid to rest; a long shot of army brass standing stiff-backed in the cold, squinting into the sun. Alec had positioned himself well away from the gravesite and the other photographers. The morning sun was high in the southern sky. A sergeant major led the riderless horse, a black boot reversed in the right stirrup, the animal sleek as marble. From somewhere nearby an invisible bugler played taps, the notes distant and pure, vivid as primary colors, but unlike primary colors they did not photograph. One of the four-star pallbearers lifted his chin, in thrall to the moment. They gave the photograph four columns above the fold on page one of the newspaper, and the next day the managing editor called Alec in and asked if he'd like to do a tour in South Vietnam, six weeks only, and he'd replied no thank you, he had a wife and young daughter and for that reason did not belong in a war zone, the half-truth delivered with effortless aplomb; and all that time he was holding the Leica and imagining what a wonderful job it would do, so compact and durable, efficient in any light or in any weather. The lens was a miracle. Taking it to the war would be like taking a Maserati to a rodeo. Alec remembered the look of disappointment on the managing editor's face and realized that his days on the paper were numbered. Everyone was expected to take a turn in Vietnam. The other photographers had all put in for it, even the most senior man, a grandfather twice over who had nothing to prove to anyone, except he had been a combat photographer in World War Two, Pacific theater, and had won a prize and thought he was owed another. He looked up to Robert Capa as Kim Malone looked up to Henry Clay. All the photographers had Capa on their minds, his skill with movement in natural light, his merriment under fire. Also, Capa was attractive to women. The managing editor's disappointment was palpable because he thought Alec was a natural. Arlington proved it.</p>
<p class="follow">You told him no? Alec's father said when they met the next day.</p>
<p class="follow">Emphatically, Alec said. And he didn't like it.</p>
<p class="follow">I can see his point.</p>
<p class="follow">So can I, Alec said. He'll get over it.</p>
<p class="follow">You could do some good over there, you know. Your work is very powerful. You have the eye for it. Everyone says so.</p>
<p class="follow">No photograph ever ended a war, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">But we should all do our part. Whatever we can.</p>

<p class="follow">Photography glorifies, Alec said. It's not trustworthy.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec, the senator began.</p>
<p class="follow">Photography makes things worse, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">The senator rolled his eyes and sighed deeply. He did not understand how his own son could turn a blind eye to the war, fail to take a stand, the stand being an obligation of citizenship. Somewhere he had failed in his obligations as a father, as a United States senator if it came to that. But he had his own troubles. He was then in the middle stages of a difficult reelection campaign. The tide was running against him and the reason was his opposition to the war. His state was fundamentally conservative and in time of war a senator was expected to support the effort. Anything less was faint-hearted, almost a sin. His opponent was a retired army major who accused the senator of being yet another entrenched Washington bureaucrat with no knowledge of military affairs, a liberal meddler who had never himself "contributed." Not him, not his family, including his able-bodied son the newspaper photographer, all far from harm's way. This was the normal thing in Washington. Force the constituents to fight the battle. Don't you want a senator who's felt the sting of shot and shell? Alec, watching his father, said nothing further, but the look on the old man's face suggested to him that politics not only trumped friendship, it trumped blood.</p>
<p class="follow">Well, the senator said, it's your choice.</p>
<p class="follow">Sorry, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">No need to get sarcastic with me—</p>
<p class="follow">You'll win your race, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Of course I will.</p>
<p class="follow">Push comes to shove, they'll want you back in the Senate.</p>
<p class="follow">It would have been quite an adventure for you, Vietnam.</p>
<p class="follow">Adventure? Not my sort of adventure.</p>
<p class="follow">Evidently, the senator said. I don't blame you for being scared. Anyone would be. I would be. I'm sure your wife's pleased.</p>
<p class="follow">That's what you think it is?</p>

<p class="follow">Sure. Part of it anyway. Why not?</p>
<p class="follow">I don't think it is, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">My only point is, I hope you've thought it through.</p>
<p class="follow">More than you have, Alec said. You didn't listen a minute ago. Photography is not trustworthy. Then, wondering how far he could push things with his father, Alec added one more thought. Photography doesn't belong in a war, he said, realizing as he said it that in six words he had swept away a hundred years of images, from Mathew Brady onward. But it was also true that Brady's photographs of the Union dead were beautiful and no less beautiful because they forced you to look and then look away before you looked once again. Robert Capa's falling Spanish militiaman was a masterpiece of arrested action, a true <em>nature morte,</em> as formally beautiful as Book 13 of the <em>Iliad.</em> The archive was full. Alec had no desire to add to it.</p>
<p class="follow">They were in his father's Senate office, its lofty ceilings, its walls lined with framed documents and photographs: the old man on an aircraft carrier wearing an officer's campaign hat a la Douglas MacArthur, in formal rooms with FDR and Harry Truman, Ike, JFK, LBJ, Adenauer, Ben-Gurion, Churchill. Kim Malone was an internationalist in a state that preferred its politics local. On a far wall, in shadows where they could be seen but dimly, were shots of the senator at the state fair behind the wheel of a vintage tractor, his blue serge suit spoiling the effect somewhat; a graduation ceremony at the university; at a Rotary Club dinner; on a park bench with Bernard Baruch. When the buzzer sounded a quorum call, the senator rose and put on his coat, ran a comb through his hair, glanced into the mirror. His legislative assistant looked in to brief him on the nature of the quorum. The senator listened carefully, then dismissed the assistant. He told Alec he would have to leave at once for the floor, an important procedural matter.</p>
<p class="follow">Always good to see you, son.</p>
<p class="follow">But by God you are a mystery to me.</p>

<p class="follow">In a moment Alec was alone in the historic office looking at the documents and photographs, the old man's public life. On his desk was a framed picture of his wife and son, pride of place it had to be said. Alec had been visiting this office for as long as he could remember. Before the photographs of Ike and JFK there had been Alben Barkley and Henry Wallace, Wallace removed sometime in the late 1940s, the errant farmer-commissar airbrushed from the American presidium. Cordell Hull, General Marshall. He remembered as a little boy sitting in his father's high-backed leather chair playing with an onyx pen set, and his father deftly removing the pens from his reach, not skipping a beat as he conferred with his legislative assistant. A grown-up's office, no question. Alec had the idea that dusty secrets hung in the air. His father's voice was always pitched low, the assistant's lower still. Even an eight-year-old boy was a risk. They talked in a side-of-the-mouth code, alluring and forbidding at the same time, the drama reaching its height when his father and the assistant burst into rough laughter, mirthless, the braying noise of the playground. The senator was getting even.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec wondered if he had made a mistake refusing the managing editor's offer. And did doubt lead him to his father's office seeking—what? Absolution? An argument? In the newspaper business war was the jewel in the crown. And his father was correct, he did have the eye for it and the agility. At the age of ten Alec was taking photographs for the old man's campaign, learning to blend into the scenery, though the trick was to make not yourself but your camera disappear. Your eyes did the work but in the excitement of the moment your eyes were filled with emotion. Probably the same was true for a war, perhaps more emotion than your eyes could accept, not that it mattered now. Whether his father was correct about fear was another question, one that could be answered only in the event. The truth was, Alec had no desire for the war, and desire always came first. Without desire you were not a craftsman but a careerist doing what they told you to do in hopes that something wonderful would happen, a prize or a shot such as Capa's of the falling militiaman. Like Verdi's <em>Requiem,</em> that one photograph would be sufficient for a life's work; yes, in the way that one glorious night of lovemaking would make it unnecessary ever to try again. So you would return often, one war after another, as the roué fell into and out of one bed after another, seeking perfection and finding it just often enough to keep your passport up to date with the relevant visas. You would never get enough of it, knowing there was always a prettier girl or a messier war on one continent or another, next month or next year. Your life would make a distinguished biography, most colorful, perhaps better read about than lived through unless you were named Capa or Casanova. Alec was satisfied with what he had done, saying no without hesitation. He knew at once he had spoken from the heart, as had the managing editor, who declared that he was making a colossal mistake passing up such a magnificent opportunity and never in his life could he have imagined that Alec Malone, of all people—and here the managing editor lapsed into French, as he had a way of doing when he was disappointed—was not after all <em>un homme engagé.</em> And asked what that meant, the managing editor thought a moment and said, "Not pledged," smiling briefly to take the edge off. What he really meant was, Not of the fraternity.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec took a last look around his father's office, the leather couch, the documents and photographs on the walls, the onyx pen set on the desk, the dust in the air, and felt like the angler who had hooked something very large. He felt the steady haul on the line but the fish would not break water. The line was taut. He had no idea what the fish looked like or whether it was a keeper or a throwaway, only that it was large.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec?</p>
<p class="follow">He turned around to face his father's private secretary.</p>
<p class="follow">The senator will be on the floor for some time, she said. Can I help you with anything? She stood to one side in the open doorway, an attractive woman in her fifties, a manila envelope in her hand. When Alec was a schoolboy she helped him with his homework. He looked at his watch and said he was leaving. No one was allowed in the senator's office when he was absent.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">Alec moved closer to his father. The old man had the blank look of the Confederate infantryman. His hair, thin, yellowish, uncombed, fell carelessly over his forehead. His father's eyes closed, opened, and closed once again. Washington in twilight, Alec thought, its eyes shut, out of breath, quarrelsome, its spirit low, the long-nosed man drawing near. Alec placed his hand on his father's shoulder, feeling bone beneath the cloth. He left his hand in place a minute or more, then gave a gentle squeeze and turned away. His father muttered something but Alec did not hear what it was. Maybe the old man had been reading his mind. If Kim Malone had spoken French, he would have said to his son what the managing editor had said. Not <em>un homme engagé,</em> but he would not have smiled when he said it.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec rose heavily and stepped to the window, watching the day's last foursome motor up the sixteenth fairway amid long shadows from the setting sun, still visible through the trees. Cherry petals blew this way and that. The fairway looked like an aisle it for a bride. High overhead Alec noticed the contrails of a passenger jet beginning its descent into Dulles and suddenly remembered his own plans for the following week, a job abroad shooting stills for a film company, a pleasant enough warm-weather job that paid well. He would be given the use of an apartment and a week to finish the shoot. He could stay on another week if he liked (uh, your own expense, Alec, but you can keep our discount), swim, play golf, drive to the sea. The company was agreeable; the director and the second lead were old friends. They were Hollywood people but unpretentious and hospitable, most professional in their approach to things. Really, it was a vacation masquerading as a shoot. He liked their Los Angeles stories and offhandedness, and he had not seen Annalise for months.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec watched the last foursome, now on the green lining up their putts. He recognized two of them, a political analyst often on Sunday morning television and a newspaper reporter. The floor nurse looked in and went away, her footsteps echoing in the corridor.</p>
<p class="follow">Who is that? the old man asked.</p>
<p class="follow">Man I know, Alec said. Newspaperman.</p>
<p class="follow">No. The person who was in my room.</p>
<p class="follow">The nurse, Alec said. She's gone now.</p>
<p class="follow">It didn't look like the nurse.</p>
<p class="follow">Who did it look like?</p>
<p class="follow">Someone else. The long-nosed man. He's been here all afternoon listening to us. He takes in every word but he never says anything. I've never heard his voice but I know he's foreign-born. He's not from around here. I don't know where he's from but I don't like him and I wish he'd go away. I'll sleep for a while, Alec. Wake me if there's a quorum call.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec nodded but did not reply. Of course he would have to postpone his trip and not make other plans. The old man slipped a little each day. Before too long, letting go, he would hear the voice of the long-nosed man and that would be it. The shoot was not important. They could get someone else to photograph. But he had been looking forward to it because of Annalise, a fair-haired friend of many years. Annalise was a burst of sunshine. At her insistence they usually gave him a bit part. Thanks to Annalise he had played various authority figures, an airline pilot, a doctor (twice), a lawyer, a sommelier. Alec had been looking forward to all of it, the shoot and the bit part and the promised rendezvous with Annalise, the actress playing the second lead, a middle-aged dancer whose life was in ruins. The part wasn't much but Annalise was glad for the work and looking forward to a week or more on the beach with Alec. Four or five times a year they got together at one place or another, usually abroad. Annalise had a careless attitude toward life and the farther she got from Los Angeles the more careless she was. The movie was being made in Morocco. Well, there was no help for it. He was all the old man had and no one should have to die among strangers. Alec watched the golfers motor off to the seventeenth tee, their laughter rising in the dusk. The political analyst was twirling her putter in her fingers, a gesture that reminded him somehow of Annalise.</p>
<p class="follow">When Alec turned back to the bed he saw the old man watching him.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec said, Are you cold? Do you want the extra blanket?</p>
<p class="follow">No blanket. He's dressed in white, you know. An ice cream suit. White coat, vest, trousers, shoes. He's standing in the doorway right now.</p>
<p class="follow">I'll tell him to go away.</p>
<p class="follow">He won't listen to you, Alec. He refuses to take instructions. He doesn't speak. He only listens. The old man took Alec's hand and smiled wolfishly, signaling a fresh thought. Did I tell you about Eliot's funeral? My goodness, the church was full. Full nave front to back. The p-prick was in the front pew with the children and grandchildren. Eliot's women were in the rear, all in a row like birds on a wire. One of them was a member of Congress when I knew her, a committee chairwoman. She had a most dubious voting record. Mrs. Danto. She was the one with the hat and the fur stole. She had the face of a gangster. What do you suppose Eliot saw in her? What was there about her except that she was for sale. Probably that excited him, negotiating the terms of the sale. Maybe it was a sale and lease-back arrangement such as's done with automobiles and real estate. Where <em>did</em> he find the time?</p>
<p class="follow">As you said, his evenings were free.</p>
<p class="follow">Did you go?</p>
<p class="follow">The funeral? No. I was out of town.</p>
<p class="follow">One of us should have been there.</p>
<p class="follow">I had a shoot, Alec said. Nantucket.</p>
<p class="follow">Is that where your movie star lives?</p>
<p class="follow">No. She lives in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="follow">Pretty girl? his father asked.</p>
<p class="follow">Very pretty, Alec said. Not a girl.</p>
<p class="follow">What's her name?</p>
<p class="follow">Annalise, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">I never knew any movie stars when I started out. Or later on, except for the last few years, fund-raisers and the like. They're all over the place now. You can't go to a rally without seeing a movie star. Up close they look different. Personally, I always liked Gregory Peck. Sound fellow. Good Democrat. Is he still alive?</p>
<p class="follow">No, Alec said. He's gone.</p>
<p class="follow">Danto. Well, she's still alive, Mrs. Danto. And she was at the funeral.</p>
<p class="follow">Everyone says it was great.</p>
<p class="follow">Washington does very well with funerals, the old man said. The sense of occasion and so forth. Ceremony. Washington loves funerals and parades. He looked up suddenly and said, You make goddamned sure that p-prick doesn't come to my funeral, not that he would. His voice trailed away and when next he spoke it was barely a whisper. He said, I've forgotten your mother.</p>
<p class="follow">No, you haven't forgotten.</p>
<p class="follow">I've forgotten. She's disappeared. I can't remember what she looked like. I don't remember her name. She's gone, isn't she?</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, Alec said. Years ago.</p>
<p class="follow">She was a peach.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Wonderful company.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, she was.</p>
<p class="follow">Wonderful campaigner, too.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">But I've forgotten her name.</p>
<p class="follow">Margaret, Alec said.</p>

<p class="follow">That's right, Margaret. Everyone called her Mag. Her name was there all along. He paused a moment in deep thought. Remember that tough campaign, 1968? She must've made a hundred speeches. So damned nervous before the speeches that her hands shook. But she made them, sometimes two, three a day about what a wonderful state we lived in and how I could be counted on to keep it that way. She saved the Senate from that damned major, the alleged war hero. Got out the women's vote. Went all over the state in a bus. We did some things in that campaign that I'm not proud of.</p>
<p class="follow">I didn't know that, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Not proud at all. But they had to be done. The son of a bitch was a menace.</p>
<p class="follow">No, I mean about mother and her nerves. You said her hands shook.</p>
<p class="follow">They did. She didn't like crowds. She never got over it. But she <em>pitched in.</em> Mag had grit. She did what had to be done, God bless her. Even so, we damn near lost.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec said, Tell me more about the '68 campaign.</p>
<p class="follow">I don't want to talk about it. I'm tired.</p>
<p class="follow">I can make you a drink. I think you could use one.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm boring you, am I?</p>
<p class="follow">Not yet, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Is it dark yet?</p>
<p class="follow">Almost dark.</p>
<p class="follow">I'll have that drink, then. Make it a double.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec poured a thimble of Scotch into a glass, filled the glass with ice and soda water, and handed it to his father.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec said, Tell me about the campaign.</p>
<p class="follow">You were no damned help, his father said.</p>
<p class="follow">I wasn't running, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Forget it, his father said. He rattled the ice in his glass. Your mother wasn't involved in what we had to do. She never knew about it. But the son of a bitch was a menace.</p>

<p class="follow">Yes, you said that.</p>
<p class="follow">He didn't know anything outside his own experience. Worse, he distrusted everything outside his own experience. With a trembling hand the old man brought the glass to his mouth and took a sip of whiskey. We tapped his telephone, for one thing. And for another—</p>
<p class="follow">Alec laughed. And they called you one of the consciences of the Senate. I forget who the others were.</p>
<p class="follow">Don't say that, his father said.</p>
<p class="follow">I was making a joke, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">It's not a joke. Not a <em>joke.</em> There were some ballot irregularities also.</p>
<p class="follow">He was an awful son of a bitch. I think you're forgiven.</p>
<p class="follow">You're good to say so, Alec. I didn't like doing it. The phone taps were indispensable. We learned our major was taking money from people he shouldn't've been taking money from. Out-of-state money. Chicago money. Mrs. Danto was the bag lady. That gets out, the damage is done, adieu Hero Major. All the Silver Stars in the army can't rescue you when you're down in the Chicago slime with Mrs. Danto.</p>
<p class="follow">But you had to do it, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, we did. Democracy. Sometimes you have to nudge it along.</p>
<p class="follow">I never heard that story, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">We leaked it to a friendly newspaper. Told them to chase the money. Told them where to look. Told them who to look for. Those were the days when newspaper publishers had some guts. Convictions. Publishers believed absolutely in the people's right to know what they thought and that was why they owned the paper, for crissakes. So they wrote two stories, short on fact, long on innuendo. The stories weren't meant for civilians. I mean the general public. They were meant for the two dozen guys who knew how to read between the lines. Later on, the story behind the story got around. It always does. Mrs. Danto told Eliot Bergruen during one of their pillow evenings. Caused quite a strain for a while, not forever. We were all grown-ups. But the word got out on the other side of the aisle and eventually on my side of the aisle and for a time I was in the doghouse. But nobody could prove anything. No witnesses came forward. And the major was fighting an indictment. The boys on the paper held up their end of the bargain, First Amendment blah blah blah, sanctity of secret sources, et cetera. So eventually the story went away. Always does. Deprive the plant of oxygen and the plant dies. Margaret never knew, though. I made sure. We try to keep these things in-house.</p>
<p class="follow">Jesus, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">There was a comic aftermath, the old man said. Mrs. Danto was in the House for thirty years. She's been in tough shape for a while. Dr. Alzheimer has paid her a visit. So a few years ago her grandchildren had the bright idea of commissioning a biography. They're proud of their granny, served in Congress all those years. They thought of her as a role model for ambitious young women and they thought also that a biography might, you know, help her out of the fog. So they found a historian who was happy to take on the task and then—he began to laugh, a kind of strangled cackle—made the mistake of sending a news release to the papers. The piece wasn't read by everyone but it was read by someone, because in due course a man came to see the grandchildren and offered to finance the project himself because he was such an admirer of Congresswoman Danto, but in order to do so he had to have access to the archive, all the private papers of granny. Every scrap of paper they had. Naturally the grandkids thought that was great. Told him where the papers were housed. And the very next day a fire-of-suspicious-origin incinerated everything. No paper, no biography. A few weeks later the kids received sizable checks from an insurance company they never heard of. So sorry for your loss.</p>

<p class="follow">Jesus, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Forget I said anything. I think about that campaign a lot. I must have a bad conscience. I can live with the bad conscience, though. What I couldn't live with was that son of a bitch in the Senate. You have to have loyalty to the institution or everything just goes to hell. That was the rule back then and we all lived by it. I don't know that conscience is negotiable currency in politics despite what you hear. Personally I don't think conscience stands a chance in the world as we know it. The world we live in. When you come down to it conscience is a utopian vision. It has no place in the Senate. Well, of course it has a place, but that place is not at the top table. The old man took a sip of whiskey, his eyes fastened on some distant object. He looked as if he were listening to an unremarkable speech on the Senate floor. He said at last, I'm tired, Alec. I've talked too much. I'm talked out. I'll rest awhile.</p>
<p class="follow">It's all right, Alec said. I've got to be going.</p>
<p class="follow">Going where?</p>
<p class="follow">Home, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">Are you still living in that little house?</p>
<p class="follow">I'm still there. It suits me.</p>
<p class="follow">Don't go just yet. Please stay. I want you to tell me a story. What do you remember most fondly? Something out of the ordinary. Not one of your damned shoots. Not the movie star. Something unexpected. Tell me something I can actually believe. Something about early days in Washington, when you were young. Something about private life. Something refreshing about the way we lived back then. Or the way you lived. I know the way I lived. Your life has always been a mystery to me, Alec. Not an unpleasant mystery but a mystery nonetheless. I've never cared for mysteries or riddles. They interfere with the legislative process. Isn't the point always to get things done? Have something to show for your day? I care even less for irony, the refuge of scoundrels who need an excuse for their refusal to act. To put a marker down. To bring things to a conclusion. So talk all you want. I'll be listening carefully even though I may close my eyes. Cheat on me and I'll know it from your tone of voice.</p>
<p class="follow">Speak up so I can hear, his father added, and with an unsteady hand he raised his glass, rattling the ice cubes.</p>
<p class="follow">More ice, please.</p>
