<h1 class="chaptertitle"><a id='bliopage114'/>DAMASCUS</h1>
<p class="left"><b>A</b><span style="font-size: smaller">LEC AND LUCIA</span> were married by a justice of the peace in Elkton, Alec's parents in attendance. The bride wore white. After a glass of champagne at an inn nearby, Alec and Lucia motored to Chestertown to pick up the boat for what turned out to be ten days of perfect weather on Chesapeake Bay. At the sports shop Lucia bought a black bikini and Alec a long-billed fisherman's hat. Lucia took up sailing as if she were born to it, having an instinct both for wind and for tide. On a broad reach, mainsail and jib bellied in the breeze, the vessel heeled over, Lucia was reminded of a thrilling downhill run, snow flying all around her, the destination out of sight but not in doubt. In the evenings they put in at one or another of the port towns, anchoring and taking the dinghy ashore for a dinner of soft-shell crabs or grilled fish. They talked constantly about the life they would have together, and whatever qualms were present disappeared in the Maryland twilight. Back on the boat by nine, asleep by ten, sometimes twelve, depending on how athletic their inclinations. <a id='bliopage115'/>They were excited at all hours, at noon when becalmed and in the early morning not becalmed, the anchor dragging. Alec poked his head above the gunwale in time to see the sandbar and hit the tiller with his bare foot, the sudden movement causing Lucia to cry out, a sound somewhere between an ambulance siren and an animal's howl. At the end of the week they decided to buy a sailboat as soon as finances allowed.</p>
<p class="follow">Bliss, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">Mathilde was born one year later. They had always led a quiet private life and now that they were a nation of three became even closer, Mathilde the center of attention. Lucia sang Swiss lullabies to her while Alec took pictures, hundreds of them. He enjoyed making shots of a subject who refused to obey commands; all responsibility rested with the photographer. Lucia settled happily into motherhood and after a short time returned to her work at the zoo one day a week. The sailboat was put on hold. Instead, Alec bought a Ford station wagon.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec's mother offered to look after Mathilde, which she did with almost comical enthusiasm. The first day she arrived with boxes of English tea and the silver tea set that had belonged to her mother. It's yours and Mathilde's now, she said; so when Lucia arrived home from work at the zoo she and her mother-in-law enjoyed a cup of tea together while Mathilde made noises from her crib. Mag Malone was always eager for news of Alec, how he was taking to fatherhood and particularly how things were going at the newspaper. Fine, Lucia said, though truthfully Alec did not speak much of the newspaper, only if there had been an interesting shoot, and those did seem to be few and far between. I think he will move on someday, Lucia said. When, I don't know. What will he do? Mag asked, alarmed because the sons of many of their friends seemed rootless, itinerant almost. I don't know that either, Lucia said. I think he is somewhat bored by news. I think <a id='bliopage116'/>that since he has become a father Alec is an indoor man. Did I tell you he bought a new car?</p>
<p class="follow">Alec's work had settled into an undemanding routine. He wondered if this work was too routine and too undemanding for a man just shy of thirty years old. He did feel at odds with the advent of the Count and Countess d'An and their menagerie next door. Suddenly he and Lucia were part of the émigré community, visiting two or three nights a week in the big garden with the towering cedar and the fountain that splashed all day and all night. The community seemed to Alec to look backward, concerned with old wounds, grievances that went back generations, and these were irreconcilable so they stayed on in America as if on the platform of a railway station, waiting for a train that never arrived. Someone somewhere should have come to their rescue. Taken an interest. Given assistance. Stood up to the Nazis, the Soviets, and their collaborators. Probably large nations always manhandled small ones, though that was not the way Lucia spoke of diminutive landlocked mountainous prosperous Switzerland, charting its own harmless course for centuries without civil unrest or war, unless you counted the unpleasantness caused by the megalomaniacal Bonaparte, author of the bloody battles of Zurich. One night Alec mentioned cuckoo clocks, making a joke. But his remark was not taken as a joke. Lucia was offended. After a moment of cold silence she said, An old complaint. I have heard it before. The truth was, Switzerland was the envy of its neighbors.</p>
<p class="follow">Mag had warned her. Alec sometimes caused offense without meaning to.</p>
<p class="follow">A gentleman never offends someone unintentionally, Lucia said, quoting the Count d'An.</p>
<p class="follow">So true, Mag said, feeling disloyal but sympathetic to her daughter-in-law. She was reminded of certain senators who were mindlessly partial to their states. The more obscure the state, the <a id='bliopage117'/>more partial they were to it. All in all, a harmless bias, though tiresome.</p>
<p class="follow">We are proud of our country, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">And with good reason, Mag said, believing that at any moment Lucia would break down. She had not touched her tea. Her voice was unnaturally low. Mag said, I am sure if Alec knew you were upset he would apologize.</p>
<p class="follow">He did apologize, Lucia said. But he was not sincere.</p>
<p class="follow">Men, Mag said, in the absence of anything else to say.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">You must speak to Alec about it. This must not come between you.</p>
<p class="follow">I intend to, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm sure Alec meant no harm, Mag said, but Lucia did not look convinced.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">Alec's work routine had been disturbed by the return of the chief photographer from the war. Ed Weekes was subdued as he gave a briefing on what the photographers could expect in Vietnam, the blood and the filth, killing heat and close combat in the rain forests and rice fields. No shortage of material, he said. There was material everywhere you looked, even up at the sky. You had only to decide where to aim your camera, which, by the way, had to be kept immaculate at all times owing to the frequent thunderstorms and the filth. The army was superb, would take you anywhere you wanted to go in comfort and relative safety. The army wanted the story of their heroic troopers in the papers and the division commanders saw their units as career-builders, publicity always welcome. You had to be careful, though, deciding where to aim the camera. The troopers didn't like you taking shots of their dead. Hated it, in fact, and it was easy getting into very bad trouble.</p>
<p class="follow">Someone asked Ed if there was an army escort with him in the field, monitoring what he did and how he did it. Did you have <a id='bliopage118'/>a babysitter, Ed? Oh, no, he said, they don't give a shit. It's the grunts who give a shit. They don't like you taking pictures of their dead friends. As a matter of privacy. Taste, we would say. They don't like interference of that kind. You couldn't explain to them that you were just trying to do your job. They didn't give a rat's ass about your job. I tried to make it clear that my shots were framed in such a way that no one could see the dead man's face. He would not be recognized by friends or family. I was making a simple shot of an infantryman on a pallet, his weapon across his chest. His face was out of the frame. He was covered by a poncho anyway. But that seemed to enrage them even more. I didn't know what to make of it so I put my camera down. To tell the truth it was a kind of no-win-type situation.</p>
<p class="follow">I didn't like it, Ed said.</p>
<p class="follow">Things were sort of out of control.</p>
<p class="follow">The company commander, a captain about the age of my son, came to take me by the arm and lead me away. For Christ's sake shut up, the captain said. You're making things worse. Their blood's high. We had a God-awful morning. You're a stranger here. You're not one of them. So back off.</p>
<p class="follow">So, Ed said, you have to watch where you point your camera. There are some things off limits. You have to find out for yourself. It's not like here, a ceremony in the Rose Garden or a congressional hearing. He fell silent then, having said all he felt he could say. After a moment one of the other photographers asked if Ed had found the war a worthwhile assignment. His work there was widely admired. Ed, did you have any fun? Ed waited a full minute before replying.</p>
<p class="follow">I'd call it a civic duty to go, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">Would you go back, Ed?</p>
<p class="follow">If they asked me to, he said, I would.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec had listened to all this with incredulity. Ed Weekes had lost his bearings. Who could believe in photography as a civic duty? Now and then a picture brought enlightenment or delight. <a id='bliopage119'/>Sometimes one brought grief, the sharp pain of recognition or remorse. That was all you could ask for. Most of the time a photograph was merely illustrative, a witness being sworn in at a congressional hearing, a woman's umbrella bending against the wind on a city street. Of course going to the war was a wise career move but that was something else entirely. That night, sitting in their garden waiting for the babysitter so they could go next door for cocktails, Alec related the conversation to Lucia. He described Ed Weekes, a tough, no-nonsense character, three decades on the job. He lived to photograph the news. Now, after Vietnam, he was—diminished. He'd lost his swagger. Probably he was too old for war duty. Everyone knew that combat was a young man's game, a young man's legs and restlessness and lust, a desire to get the shot at all costs. Lucia misunderstood. She said, You're not going over there, are you, Alec? I'd hate it if you were. No, Alec said. I have you and Mathilde. Why would I go to Vietnam? I don't know, she said. Maybe you'd think it was your civic duty. I don't think that, he said. That isn't the way I think.</p>
<p class="follow">She wanted to make certain, so she asked him, Why not?</p>
<p class="follow">Alec said, I'm just a photographer, Lucia. I don't make any great claims for what I do. I'm good at it. But it's not worth a life, mine or anyone else's. I don't like war and I don't intend to contribute to it.</p>
<p class="follow">I'd never forgive you if you went.</p>
<p class="follow">Drop it, he said, suddenly angry.</p>
<p class="follow">I don't like it when you speak to me like that.</p>
<p class="follow">Then drop it, he said, more gently now.</p>
<p class="follow">Thirty minutes later Alec was standing near the d'Ans' fountain, drinking champagne. Lucia had retreated to the back of the garden, she and two of the second-tier intellectuals deep in conversation, leaving Alec with Ronald diAntonio and General Symjon. They were talking about the assassination, the latest report, more questions. The killing was almost four years back but its <a id='bliopage120'/>shadow was still present, a stain on democracy's honor. Ronald thought Washington was disoriented, no longer the hospitable place it had been. The city had lost confidence. Its sense of itself was rattled and it seemed suddenly old and enfeebled, yet at the same time truculent as a schoolyard bully. The war went on and on, Johnson's war, which he could neither win nor end. General Symjon remarked that Washington reminded him of his own capital after the Anschluss. No one could believe it, yet there it was, a beautiful grande dame transformed overnight into a witch. Do you think the CIA was behind Dallas, Alec? What does your father say? Alec mumbled something noncommittal. His father refused to discuss the assassination and even now, facing a difficult election, was vague and unconvincing in his campaign speeches and the audience Q and A that followed. Oswald ... acting alone ... the country must move on ... put this behind us. The general said that the important thing was to draw the correct lessons. This will happen again, he said. Once begun, there is no end of it. Assassination is a hereditary disease. Ronald and the general began to speak of cities, the character of the metropolis, how one capital differed from another. Paris, the seat of government, was only nominally a political city; Washington was nothing but. Alec was only half listening, preoccupied as he was with Vietnam as a civic duty. Then the general said something so odd that Alec touched his arm and asked him to repeat what he had said.</p>
<p class="follow">I was telling Ronald about Damascus, the general said. I see it as a dark, sullen city without any particular charm. Routine architecture, much of it of recent construction. As it happens, there is great beauty in Damascus but the beauty lies in the interior spaces. You must get inside the walls, into the courtyards. Once inside the courtyards you must open the doors that lead to the great rooms. Then it is fabulous. Beyond description. You find yourself in another world, centuries past. Mosaics of the most <a id='bliopage121'/>extraordinary complexity, mesmerizing in their intricacy. I daresay—the general smiled in recollection—you find yourself in the skin of another.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">Every so often Alec arrived home late to find the party next door still in full throat. He could hear the general's parade-ground voice and Lucia's laughter. Alec would dismiss the babysitter, old Mrs. Bazaroff, who lived around the corner and loved Mathilde, and take his daughter into the garden where they would sit quietly together and look at the roses. Alec was teaching her their proper names: 'Betty Prior', Rosa 'Eureka', Rosa 'François Rabelais', and the grim-faced one he called Rosa 'Photographera'. That was the one without character and the one Mathilde took to. She was such a sweet child, grave of manner but with an impish smile when she chose to use it. After the rose reverie Alec would read to her and put her to bed and return to the garden, this time with a drink in hand to wait for Lucia, who always arrived slightly breathless with startling stories from the émigrés because there were always new arrivals with fresh anecdotes from their troubled homelands, eyewitness accounts of indignities and dissension. She would ask him about his day, and as he told her of his assignments he knew how banal he sounded, recounting the shoot on Capitol Hill or the White House, a portrait of some new cabinet member or senior Pentagon general. She had no more interest in this work than he did.</p>
<p class="follow">But there was something new today, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">The entertainment editor had assigned him—a temporary thing, she had said, but see what you can make of it—to a shoot at a small theater off Connecticut Avenue, a rehearsal of a contemporary drama. Alec liked the way the actors used their bodies, how they stood, and how they gestured. A tilt of the head or a sudden shift of weight had meaning no less assured than the lines they spoke. He was accustomed to shooting men at microphones, often reading from a script. Prepared text, they liked to say. These <a id='bliopage122'/>actors, especially the women, were lithe and composed assembling disparate parts into a harmonious whole. Alec found himself shooting from unfamiliar angles to get in the skin of the actors. Later, he joined the company for a beer backstage, curious to see how their off-job manner differed from their on-job manner. They were exceedingly affable, interested in his work for the newspaper and attentive when he described shoots in the Oval Office or on Capitol Hill, the staginess of them and the symbols—the microphone at the hearing, the gesture with the furled document, an American flag always somewhere nearby. While the actors talked among themselves Alec squeezed off a dozen shots—not for the newspaper but for them. Alec decided that their on-job manner and their off-job manner differed pretty much as his own did. You had a working face and a nonworking face. Same face, different focus. An audience made the difference.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec told Lucia that he had produced a unique portfolio; at any event, he had never done anything quite like it. The editor of the entertainment pages agreed but not for the same reason. We'll use one of them, she said, but forget the others. These are not what we expected. Why the odd angles? The way you photographed this troupe, they look like anybody you'd see on the street. We wanted the sort of shot you make on the Hill or in the Rose Garden. Something with some glamour to it.</p>
<p class="follow">They aren't glamorous people, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Wrong, the editor replied. They're actors. My readers want to see actors. Actors mean glamour.</p>
<p class="follow">Driving home, Alec had the idea he was not meant to work for other people. He had lived in Washington his entire life but could no longer recognize himself in it. Perhaps he knew it too well. He knew suddenly that he was an artisan in search of material, the block of wood that became a refectory table, the iron slag that became a cemetery fence, or the lump of gold that became Lucia's choker. He was in search of a subject and wondered if he <a id='bliopage123'/>had found it on the stage of the theater off Connecticut Avenue. He felt an affinity with the actors in a way that seemed impossible with political figures—and that was the trouble, they were "figures." Nor was it a matter of age. One of the actors was older than his father. He was loose in his skin, that one, with a natural merriment. Photographing the rehearsal, Alec felt a part of it even while he was trying to make his camera disappear. He saw himself growing old before his own eyes with nothing much to show for it except a White House press pass and a portfolio of staged glossies.</p>
<p class="follow">Then something very strange happened, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">The night was chilly. He stopped at the traffic light just beyond Washington Circle. A man and a woman, lovers from the look of them, were talking earnestly on the sidewalk in front of a Greek restaurant. The man wore a red scarf and a black short-billed cap of the sort favored by V. I. Lenin in his revolutionary youth. He held his cigarette ash end up, between his thumb and forefingers, gesticulating as he spoke, unmistakably a European. Alec watched them with his photographer's eyes, and when the woman turned toward him his breath caught in his throat. Olivia Sorrensen stared at him as she listened to the man in Lenin's cap whose voice rose in a sour inventory of complaint, the internal contradictions of the State De-pot-ment, filled with idiots who failed to appreciate his genius—and then his words were lost, run together in frustration. The accent was pure Hibbing via Foggy Bottom. Olivia's face was pale in the wan glow of the streetlights. Her eyes grew wide and she made a little gesture with her hand that said to Alec, Don't interfere. Alec was in the process of rolling down his window. Robert Sorrensen looked at him sternly, evidently the look he liked to use at embassy gatherings.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec said, Excuse me. Which way to M Street?</p>
<p class="follow">You're on M Street, Robert said.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, of course. I mean Wisconsin Avenue.</p>
<p class="follow">Well, make up your mind.</p>
<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage124'/>Alec couldn't help smiling at this sorry imitation of an out-of-patience ambassador. Olivia's hand went to her forehead as she looked away.</p>
<p class="follow">Wisconsin Avenue, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Robert ground his cigarette beneath the heel of his shoe. He said, Straight ahead.</p>
<p class="follow">Thanks, Alec said pleasantly. Good night to you. Good night, miss.</p>
<p class="follow">Good night, Olivia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Have a pleasant evening, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">The light turned green and he put the car in gear, accelerating slowly. In the rear-view mirror he saw them watching him and then Robert turned to her, his shoulders rising, saying something more. Olivia shook her head but continued to watch Alec's car slowly drift up M Street. And then they turned and walked the other way. Two feet of distance separated them but it might as well have been a continent. Olivia did not seem much changed except the look in her eyes when she made the defeated gesture that said to him, Don't interfere. Don't come close. Drive away. Alec continued to watch them in the rear-view mirror. Robert was wiry of build, thin-faced, narrow-shouldered. He seemed to have a prisoner's pallor but that could have been the glare of the streetlight. Robert put a cigarette in his mouth. His lighter flared and in a sudden movement he tore the cap off his head and tried to stuff it in his pocket—Lenin no more, merely another disappointed apparatchik. The cap fell to the ground and they both reached for it, bowing, holding the pose. And in that moment, Alec said to Lucia, they both seemed like actors lit by stage lights.</p>
<p class="follow">Why did you stop? Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">I don't know, he said. Impulse.</p>
<p class="follow">A strange impulse, Alec.</p>
<p class="follow">Not so strange. I felt sorry for her. She was a nice girl. She deserved better than Robert.</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage125'/>Why did you tell me that story? When she first heard the story of the Sorrensens she was charmed. She remembered the Italian restaurant and the filthy Chianti and Alec's soft voice as he described his affair with Olivia, lonely because her husband was bewitched by Russia. He told the story without one ounce of bravado and she liked that, too. Lucia believed she was listening to a romantic and she felt in safe hands. But she was not charmed now, believing that Alec was leaving something unsaid. She waited for the answer to her question.</p>
<p class="follow">Because it had life, Alec said. Because it was genuine. Like the actors were genuine.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">Then the count and countess moved to Kleinwalsertal, the lawyers arrived, and Alec and Lucia bought the larger house down the street. Like Damascus, the exterior was commonplace, whitewashed brick. The brickwork needed repair and the window frames a fresh coat of paint. But the interior was very fine, a living room and separate dining room and large kitchen. Alec's plans were on hold, and he himself was gripped by a stubborn inertia, unable to find a clear way forward. He and Lucia saw the emigres but not so frequently. Once a month they would be invited to someone's house in Falls Church or Bethesda and once a month they would have them back. Often Lucia went alone, Alec delayed with a shoot. Ambassador Kryg died, his funeral held in a tiny church in far northwest Washington, the body flown from Sardinia for the occasion, the casket draped with the Czech flag. His many decorations were displayed in a row atop the flag. Sitting with strangers in the second pew, Lucia found herself in tears, the ambassador buried so far from home; his family was long gone and he was attended only by the exiles. She had no idea whether Sardinia had been a success or only another anteroom. She had never forgotten their conversation concerning her father, a subject to which they never returned. No doubt Kryg was <a id='bliopage126'/>a brute and unreliable but she felt a kinship with him, his fundamental Czechness, his displacement.</p>
<p class="follow">After the ambassador's funeral, invitations from the émigrés slowed and then ceased and now when Alec arrived home from work Lucia was waiting for him. When he asked her what she had done with her day, she'd reply that she'd gone to the National Gallery or the Corcoran. Lunch with someone. Often she went to the zoo to see her friend the bear girl. Now when they went out in the evenings it was to the houses of Alec's friends, some from the office, some whom he had met on the job, others from his school days in Washington. They were pleasant, occasionally hilarious evenings; they called themselves the government in exile, plotting Nixon's overthrow in 1972. The war went on and on, water rushing downhill. At the center of events was the enigmatic Nixon, a closed personality, an actor in the national drama for three decades, a dark figure neither liked nor trusted; yet the American people trusted him. No one at the table had a line into the White House so their various theories about what the administration was up to were the purest conjecture. The journalists among them were the most frustrated. They had always had friends in the administration, whichever administration it happened to be, but this one was different. What did Nixon do in his spare time? Did he drink? He was said to drink but no one had seen him drinking. Drink was the key to Nixon but the facts awaited verification. Nixon's drinks were like Kennedy's girls—no leaks. They worried the moral equivalent of a double Scotch as opposed to a willing debutante but could come to no satisfactory means of laying out the story in a newspaper article. The secrets were there to be flushed, like a covey of stubborn quail. But they refused to show themselves.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia was unable to comprehend the allure of Nixon, so awkward physically, so humorless. She had formed a friendship with the wife of one of Alec's oldest friends, a foreign correspondent <a id='bliopage127'/>for one of the newsmagazines. Gretta was new to Washington—she had met her husband in London—and not au courant with American politics, especially Nixon politics. At dinners, as fragments of Nixon's biography flew by, Lucia was able to supply context for the various shards: Hannah, the dog Checkers, the Republican cloth coat, and the Fund. Gretta and Lucia were usually seated close to each other by the thoughtful hostess, who assumed they would have much in common, immigrant girls from Sweden and Switzerland, prosperous neutral nations content to remain on the margins of events. But now and again a name would surface that would mean nothing to Lucia and she would look down the table to Alec.</p>
<p class="follow">Explain to Gretta. Who was Irving Peress?</p>
<p class="follow">And Alec would bring the table to a full stop with a laborious explanation of the army dentist suspected of communist tendencies as Gretta's eyes grew wide with astonishment. She and Lucia would laugh gaily as the impatient table returned to its reprise of the Hiss case, Whittaker Chambers, the Maryland farm, the microfilm, the pumpkin, and where Nixon fit in.</p>
<p class="follow">At the end of the meal the men stayed at the table. A bottle of cognac appeared together with cigars as the conversation continued, everyone talking at once, frequent laughter and cursing. The life of Richard Nixon was inexhaustible, as various as a Balzac novel, with ever so much yet to come.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia and Gretta retreated to the couch. They talked about their children and their husbands and the houses they lived in and where they went on vacations. Gretta confided that she returned to Sweden for a month each summer to see her family and friends. She liked speaking her language again, liked catching up with everyone, liked hiking in the woods, adored herring in oil. Her family had a cabin north of Stockholm, near Sundsvall on the Gulf of Bothnia. Do you know it, Lucia?</p>
<p class="follow">No, Lucia had never been to Scandinavia.</p>
<p class="follow">It's beautiful, Gretta said. So wild. So quiet.</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage128'/>Every summer for a month?</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, Gretta said. I insisted before Charlie and I were married.</p>
<p class="follow">It's been years since I was home, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">You must go, Gretta said. It's important for us not to lose touch with our countries. Would Alec object?</p>
<p class="follow">I don't know, Lucia said. I don't think so.</p>
<p class="follow">Insist, Gretta said. We are not slaves after all.</p>
<p class="follow">Gretta went on to talk of her family and extended family and friends whom she had known since childhood, friends from grammar school and university. Her parents were no longer young but they were vigorous, great walkers. Her father owned a small sailboat. They had a rough-made tennis court at the cabin, and she and her father would take on her two brothers, family games that would last for hours, evenly matched games. All the time they were playing tennis her mother would be at her easel on the bluff overlooking the water, painting landscapes. And at the end of the afternoon we gather in the kitchen and cook dinner, a family feast. Of course there are disagreements. We are a normal family and Swedish and everyone has his own opinion, especially my brothers. But it is a wonderful month for me...</p>
<p class="follow">Oh, Lucia. I'm sorry. Did I say something wrong?</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia was near tears. I'm envious, that's all.</p>
<p class="follow">Do you hate Washington?</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia shook her head.</p>
<p class="follow">Well, then—</p>
<p class="follow">Things are so complicated, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Gretta gave her a close look, understanding at once. She said, You need a month away.</p>
<p class="follow">Perhaps I do.</p>
<p class="follow">Insist on it, Gretta said. Washington is very foreign to us. Dentists with communist tendencies. Pumpkins with microfilm. Washington is difficult in other ways. It is very provincial. It is a provincial town concerned with itself alone. They are always so preoccupied.</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage129'/>The men, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes. Charlie is different here than he was in London. We often went to the opera. The symphony. Three or four times a month to the theater. In London we knew different kinds of people, actors and artists. We knew layabouts also. There are no layabouts in Washington. Maybe you've met some. I never have. Our London layabouts, goodness they enjoyed themselves. Doing nothing, having a wonderful time. Charlie was exciting to be with, so—she lowered her voice—ardent. Ready for anything. Sometimes I go to New York just to get away. I miss Europe.</p>
<p class="follow">So do I, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">We could go together sometime, Gretta said.</p>
<p class="follow">A weekend in New York.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, a weekend. Girls' night out.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia glanced over at the table, Alec and Charles and the two other men and their wives. The men were looking at Gretta, her almost-black hair and her fine features, her blue eyes. In Sweden and later in London she had been a model, much in demand. They were looking at Lucia, no doubt wondering what it was that engaged them so, their heads close together, their voices low. They were telling secrets, that much was obvious. Theirs was a zone of closed intimacy.</p>
<p class="follow">Washington was different when Kennedy was president, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">It was?</p>
<p class="follow">Yes. At times almost lighthearted.</p>
<p class="follow">It makes a difference to them? Who's president.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, it does.</p>
<p class="follow">Gretta broke into a wide smile. It makes no difference in Sweden. One is like another.</p>
<p class="follow">Of course we have our king.</p>
<p class="follow">Nor in Switzerland. Except we don't have a king.</p>
<p class="follow">Everyone everywhere mourned Kennedy. Was he as good-looking as his photographs?</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage130'/>Better, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">You met him?</p>
<p class="follow">At a reception, Lucia said. I was working as an au pair for our ambassador. I went with the ambassador and his wife and we talked, the president and I. I had no idea what to say to him but he put me at ease right away. He had beautiful eyes. And mischief. I would say he was up to mischief.</p>
<p class="follow">The world is more amusing when there is mischief, Gretta said. Mischief and layabouts.</p>
<p class="follow">Gretta, Lucia said, there's something else. She looked at her friend, already beginning to smile, and decided not to go on with something else. She said instead, I think Alec is unhappy at work.</p>
<p class="follow">That's a very bad sign, Gretta said. Was that what you wanted to tell me?</p>
<p class="follow">He doesn't talk about it much, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Strange, Gretta said. The office is topic A in our house. Even so, I always thought Alec was a little different in his approach to things. He never seemed quite as invested as Charlie and the others. Maybe it's because he grew up here.</p>
<p class="follow">I can't imagine growing up here, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">If he wants to move on, you should encourage him.</p>
<p class="follow">I should?</p>
<p class="follow">Something else might be more interesting, Gretta said, with a two-way smile.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia did not reply. Both women glanced at the dinner table. Charlie was saying something about the war, a fresh offensive with more casualties than expected. When he fini shed, no one said anything.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia? Alec said. Time to get home, don't you think?</p>
<p class="follow">I'm going to New York on Friday, Gretta murmured. Do you want to come?</p>
<p class="follow">I can't, Lucia said. Someone's invited us to dinner Saturday.</p>
<p class="follow">Okay, Gretta said. But one last thing, and please listen to me. When you take your month in Switzerland, go alone. Let Alec <a id='bliopage131'/>take care of your daughter. Every so often it's good to get away by yourself, see friends, be on your own. A change of pace for you without responsibilities. Europe is lovely in the autumn. Send me a postcard.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">One night a week later, Lucia said to Alec, Perhaps I am a little homesick.</p>
<p class="follow">I thought you might be, Alec said. It's been quite a while.</p>
<p class="follow">Does it show? My homesickness?</p>
<p class="follow">A little, Alec said. It's natural.</p>
<p class="follow">Only a visit, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">I have to cover the campaign, Alec said. The midterm elections. You can't imagine how excited they are at the office. I wish I could be. He hesitated, thinking of one airplane flight after another, with a Holiday Inn at the end of the day. He said, I'll be gone most of next month, on the road with the candidates. Perhaps then, if you like.</p>
<p class="follow">I think I would, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">It's the perfect time.</p>
<p class="follow">October in Switzerland, Lucia said. Zurich in the fall.</p>
<p class="follow">It's settled, then. Mathilde will love the mountains. She can practice her German.</p>
<p class="follow">I'll get Mrs. Bazaroff to stay with her while we're away.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec was startled at this unexpected turn. You're not taking her?</p>
<p class="follow">Not this time. She'll be fine with Mrs. Bazaroff.</p>
<p class="follow">Poor Mathilde. She'll be disappointed.</p>
<p class="follow">Mathilde will be fine, Alec.</p>
<p class="follow">I didn't realize you wanted to go alone. I assumed it would be you and Mathilde.</p>
<p class="follow">Is there anything wrong with me going alone?</p>
<p class="follow">No, he said. It's fine. I assumed—</p>
<p class="follow">Okay, she said, and when she spoke she heard Gretta's voice.</p>
<p class="follow">Will you have a place to stay?</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage132'/>I'll find one. I still have friends in Zurich.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec said, Just so long as his name's not Stefan.</p>
<p class="follow">Oh, Alec, she said, don't be silly.</p>
<p class="follow">By now he's probably fat and rich, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">And married, Lucia said, though she did not believe he was married.</p>
<p class="follow">Good, Alec said. I'll call the travel agent.</p>
<p class="follow">She leaned across the table and kissed him.</p>
<p class="follow">This will be my last campaign, he said suddenly. I'm leaving the newspaper, finding something new. I don't know what. Maybe another city.</p>
<p class="follow">When did this happen?</p>
<p class="follow">I've been thinking about it forever, Alec said. Lately he had been photographing antiwar demonstrators and found he had little sympathy or compassion for them. He did not photograph them sympathetically. They seemed to blame the troops for the war and Alec believed the troops deserved compassion. They were the ones who were dying, three hundred in the past week, one bloody offensive after another.</p>
<p class="follow">What city? Lucia said, alarm in her voice. Where?</p>
<p class="follow">New York, he said. Los Angeles. I don't know. I haven't thought it through. It's something for us to think about, though. We can make some decisions after you get back from Zurich. Think of it as an adventure. Do you know my assignment tomorrow and the day after tomorrow? The Sunday magazine has decided to run a photo essay on ambassadors. How they spend their time away from the job. The sports they favor. What they do. Where they go. The Colombian, the Irish, the Moroccan, the Japanese, and the Nigerian. Sound familiar?</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia smiled but did not reply.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec was surprised at her lack of enthusiasm. Fear was in her voice. He said, Would you mind leaving Washington?</p>
<p class="follow">But our house—</p>
<p class="follow">We'd sell it. The way prices are now, we'd make a fortune. He <a id='bliopage133'/>began an explanation of the Washington housing market, unprecedented inflation, but Lucia shook her head.</p>
<p class="follow">I hadn't thought about it, she said. I don't know. Lucia turned from him, a bothered expression on her face. They were sitting in their garden after dinner. A warm night, and from the open window next door they heard faint laughter and applause, a television program. She smiled, remembering a remark she'd heard that afternoon. Television is to America what the drum is to Africa, a sacred instrument.</p>
<p class="follow">I think you have more of a life here than I do, Alec said. And I grew up in Washington. Either it changed or I did.</p>
<p class="follow">Perhaps if you made more of an effort...</p>
<p class="follow">That's what I used to say to you.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, you did.</p>
<p class="follow">And look what happened.</p>
<p class="follow">And your mother, Lucia said hurriedly. I think she couldn't stand it, being separated from Mathilde. She comes over here all the time. She loves being with her granddaughter. And Mathilde loves her gran.</p>
<p class="follow">True enough, Alec said. But is that a reason to stay? Then a fresh thought came to him, an entirely unexpected idea. He said, Maybe we should go to Europe.</p>
<p class="follow">Oh, Alec. She started to laugh.</p>
<p class="follow">What's so funny?</p>
<p class="follow">Europe's not your place. That's silly.</p>
<p class="follow">How do you know Europe's not my place?</p>
<p class="follow">Don't be crazy, she said. I can't see you there, is all.</p>
<p class="follow">I can fit in anywhere, he said. And we're not getting any younger.</p>
<p class="follow">Europe, she said, and forced another laugh. Is not the fountain of youth it's cracked up to be.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia picked up phrases of American slang all the time but this one was new to him, at least from her. He wondered where she heard it. Probably at Mathilde's school, or from the bear girl, <a id='bliopage134'/>the friend she visited so often at the zoo. At the moment Lucia spoke, Alec began to smile, attracted by the idea of Europe, a change of venue, something novel, a voyage of discovery. Who knew what Europe was cracked up to be? Alec wondered if he could find a fresh subject abroad, something remote from the news, from deadlines and thoughts about civic duty. The image before him was Ed Weekes, itching to return to the war zone in Vietnam, Ed as worn out as Washington itself, settled now into a long twilit afternoon, the Nixon gang in charge. No matter who was in charge he felt himself a stranger in the city, almost a stranger to himself. There were days when he believed he was sleepwalking. Last week, riding home on the bus, he looked up to find himself at Massachusetts Avenue Heights, eight blocks past his stop. Alec had commenced a reverie about sailing on the Chesapeake Bay, the weather warm, dead calm. His was the only vessel in sight, and his thoughts turned to Europe. He longed for something unfamiliar and wondered if Europe was his subject. Of course he was surprised at Lucia's lack of enthusiasm. Perhaps she was becoming a good American after all, suspicious of foreign entanglements. She had ceased to slip away as he feared she was when in the company of the exiles, awash in resentment and nostalgia. Switzerland would be good for her, and when she returned they could think about a place to live. And meanwhile he could think about job prospects, something exciting.</p>
<p class="follow">Maybe it's not a good time, Lucia said. My trip home.</p>
<p class="follow">You'll be fine, Alec said. He had no idea how to begin prospecting for a job in Europe. He had no European contacts. The only Europeans he knew lived in Washington.</p>
<p class="follow">It's been so long, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">That's a good reason to go now, Alec said. He had one friend who worked for Agence France-Presse, an older man, Henri somebody. He could take Henri for lunch, pick his brains. It would be wonderful not working for a newspaper or agency, just setting up as a freelance, picking and choosing. Somehow you <a id='bliopage135'/>had to establish yourself. You needed to do more than show up at Orly with a Leica and a bag full of film.</p>
<p class="follow">Not always, Alec, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">What? Alec said, lost in his reverie.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">On a Wednesday afternoon two weeks later they were waiting at the gate for the short flight from National to JFK, where Lucia would board the Swissair overnight to Zurich. Alec and Mathilde were inspecting the bears at the gift shop, Alec waiting patiently for his daughter to make up her mind. Lucia watched them, Mathilde inspecting each bear before putting it back in its place, Alec standing, his hands clasped behind his back, watching as if the decision would decide the fate of the world. His face was unreadable. She thought of it as his Chinese mask, nothing given, nothing accepted; and yet he was instantly recognizable as an American, loose-limbed in his khaki trousers and polo shirt. Nothing could be further from a Chinese than Alec Malone and still she thought of his look as Chinese. Lucia wondered if he unnerved his subjects, his face as blank as a camera's lens. Now Mathilde turned toward him with a brown bear in her hand and he nodded as he handed her a banknote. The cashier was watching this pantomime with an amused expression. When Mathilde handed up the money the cashier took it and carefully counted out the change, placing each coin in the little girl's hand. Alec said something and Mathilde smiled and put the coins in her child's purse.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia heard Mathilde say, <em>Danke, Papa.</em></p>
<p class="follow">Alec said, You're welcome, sweetheart.</p>
<p class="follow">They stood a moment more looking at the goods on offer.</p>
<p class="follow">The flight was announced. Lucia called to them but her words stuck in her throat. She had an instant of irresolution as she watched them turn and come toward her hand in hand, Mathilde clutching her bear, Alec so tall. At that moment she wondered how she could love anyone but him, them. But it seemed she had reinvented herself in America as everyone was supposed to do, <a id='bliopage136'/>and some of these reinventions came without notice or forethought. Sometimes you made the choice, sometimes it was made for you. A land of opportunity certainly, pushed along by happenstance—take one turn and not another, open this door and not that, remain at the party longer than you intended, and your life changes utterly. You find you are in harm's way and the harm comes willy-nilly, out of left field as her husband liked to say. Perhaps "harm" was not the correct word because you were borne aloft, weightless; harm was the last thing in your mind. Still, when she thought about it—connecting the dots, as it were—the events of that evening could be traced to a ski slope in the Engadine, a beautiful run on virgin powder and her downhill ski suddenly out of control. She heard her bones snap when she fell. The shock was so great she felt no pain, at least not right away. Pain came later, and later still the souvenir, a limp that became more pronounced in night air. Had she not broken her leg she would never have gone to America as an au pair. Au pair work was not her interest. Her interest was competing in Europe, the downhill, the giant slalom. The downhill was her specialty. Also, she loved the company of skiers, their physicalness, their daring, their love of the cold. And if she had stayed healthy and continued to improve her technique, surely she would have been a candidate for the Winter Olympics. She believed something precious had been taken from her in the Engadine. She was diminished, her life's dream forfeit.</p>
<p class="follow">Call me when you get in, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">If the pension has a phone, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Safe trip, Alec said. He kissed her deeply.</p>
<p class="follow">Probably there won't be a phone, Lucia said. I'll cable.</p>
<p class="follow">Mathilde began to sniffle but stopped when Alec swept her into the air and held her suspended like an acrobat. Alec let her down slowly into her mother's arms.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia said, See you very soon, darling. Be a good girl.</p>
<p class="follow">Mathilde clung to Lucia, her arms tight around her mother's <a id='bliopage137'/>neck. For a long moment they did not move. Mathilde was sniffling again.</p>
<p class="follow">I'll be back before you know it, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Tell mama what you call your bear, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">The little girl was breathless. Swissbear, she said. I'm calling her Swissbear.</p>
<p class="follow">Then Lucia was in the cabin searching for her seat. The aircraft was not crowded. She fastened her seat belt as the plane eased away from the gate and began its slow progress to the far end of the field. All Lucia's irresolution returned as she stared out the window. She saw the lights of the Capitol dome but did not pay attention. She sat motionless as the plane took off to the west, banking sharply over Georgetown University. She searched for her house but could not locate it. She saw the spires of the National Cathedral and then they were in cloud and as suddenly above it, into the blue; dusk was coming on. Lucia opened the newspaper and read it listlessly. Toward the back of the front section she saw a photograph of a demonstration on the sidewalk in front of the White House, an antiwar affair, beards for the men, sandals for the women. It seemed that every day or so protesters showed up on the White House sidewalk. Her own thoughts were far away, memory snowflakes that seemed to dissolve upon arrival. Lucia put the newspaper away, then picked it up again to look at the credit line. Photo by Alec Malone. She dropped the paper on the seat next to hers. Lucia closed her eyes.</p>
<p class="follow">She was back in the Engadine, the brilliant blue sky and the snow as clean and soft as down. She was alone, the time late afternoon. She was meeting friends for drinks, <em>gluhwein</em> and fondue at the second station. A boy she was interested in had joined the crowd. Oh, she was flying, skiing as fast as she had ever skied, and then she was turning cartwheels, the sky and the snow and the snow and the sky turning above her, out of control absolutely. Her goggles were filled with snow. She had lost her gloves and a fingernail. Her leg was under her at an unnatural angle. Lucia <a id='bliopage138'/>wept not from pain but from grief. Her grief was of the sort reserved for the death of a loved one or the end of a precious dream, a dream she had held her entire life. When she heard her bones snap she lost consciousness, but grief stayed with her. She remained in the hospital one month, eating little, speaking not at all. She tried to adapt herself to her new circumstances as everyone said she must do. But she was not good at adapting. She was determined to find again what she had lost. But soon enough she understood that nothing could be done, not with money, not with love, not with friendship or God. She was kaput. When the stewardess touched her arm and said they would be landing shortly at JFK, Lucia gave a start and cried out.</p>
<p class="follow">She was over the Atlantic now. She ordered a split of champagne, thinking of the Count and Countess d'An and the night she was leaving the party at their house and stumbled on the loose flagstone, her leg buckling, and she felt a strong hand on her elbow and another around her waist. Nikolas had come to her rescue and so she stayed on for another glass of champagne. She did not know him well, in fact they had only been introduced earlier that evening. She had forgotten his name and had to ask. Nikolas was one of the second-tier intellectuals who naturally was not second-tier in his own country but a prodigy, a full professor of literature, a fixture in the lecture halls and at the many discreet protest meetings in Prague and Budapest and beyond. His aim was to sweep away the arthritic hand of the Soviet occupation and install true socialism, socialism with a human face, practical socialism whose salient feature would be freedom of speech. Lucia did not truly understand his politics, though many of his phrases were reminiscent of her mother's salon. She was drawn to his conviction, his voice and manner, his wit. Nikolas was very clever. He had long, wavy brown hair and wore a six-foot white scarf whatever the season. The scarf was his signature. He had the rough looks of a mountain peasant, a heavy jaw and a bulbous nose and permanent stubble; no one would call him handsome. <a id='bliopage139'/>Instead, Nikolas had vitality and a beautiful smile. Lucia looked into his black eyes and saw a thousand years of dissent from authority—any authority, parental, the state, the church, the sciences. There was nothing the least dutiful about him. She remembered thinking that he would be a handful for anyone who came to love him. His voice was gruff but his eyes sparkled. When he spoke, she smiled without quite knowing why, except the experience was like tapping your foot to an infectious rhythm. Nikolas had written one successful book, an allegorical novel whose subversive meaning had somehow eluded the authorities, who readily granted him permission to visit America. They thought he might be useful. Keep your eyes open. Tell us what you hear and see. Report back.</p>
<p class="follow">Nikolas said, They thought I would make a fine advertisement for the Hungarian way of life. Because I was so reliable.</p>
<p class="follow">He had a year's appointment as a visiting professor at one of the Washington universities, and when the year was up he arranged to stay on. He was extremely popular with his students, his classes always oversubscribed. His female students called him Professor Nik. He disappeared for a time, and when next seen had been granted political asylum. Professor Nik was now an official émigré, much in demand at conferences and symposia.</p>
<p class="follow">Nikolas was too young to be unconditionally accepted by the older émigrés—and perhaps his novel was a bit facile, a bit too quick with its ironies, and quite a bit too caustic in its treatment of the aging European diaspora. Nostalgia was the enemy of progress. Madame Brun believed he was not serious. He was charming in his own way, a sensuous boy, but he wrote with a curled lip. Yet he was popular among the Americans he had come to know, fellow academics and State Department analysts and those few journalists who covered foreign affairs. Nikolas was always good for a droll quote. He did have a biting wit—the drum analogy was his—and if he had read half the books he claimed to have read, he was a very well educated man indeed. Nikolas <a id='bliopage140'/>confessed to Lucia that he had a photographic memory and a talent for speed-reading and mimicry—gifts, he said disarmingly, like wavy brown hair and a big nose. He and Lucia were drawn to each other over the glass of champagne. It turned out that Nikolas was a distant cousin of a friend of the Countess d'An, so they were certain to meet again.</p>
<p class="follow">The next week they had coffee at one of the Georgetown cafés, then graduated to afternoon movies in out-of-the-way locations. One afternoon they drove to Baltimore to see <em>Catch-22,</em> a work of genius according to Nikolas, though Lucia thought it violent. They conversed in German. Lucia told him of her mother's salon in Zurich, making it sound <em>gemütlich</em> and clandestine at the same time. In his company she found that she remembered the smallest details, the brand of tea her mother served and the name of the shop the little cakes came from. Now that she was speaking German again she recalled whole conversations in her mother's salon. Nikolas seemed to unlock her memory.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia said, Do you know the work of Walter Benjamin?</p>
<p class="follow">Nikolas said, Of course.</p>
<p class="follow">They talked about Benjamin all the time, his monomania, his paranoia, his obsession with commerce, his difficult sentences, more difficult even in German than in English translation. Walter Benjamin was a displaced person of the most radical sort, in Lucia's mother's opinion, and Nikolas readily agreed. Lucia was about to say that her husband had never read Walter Benjamin. Had no idea who he was. But in the end she said nothing. She never brought Alec into their conversations.</p>
<p class="follow">Nikolas was eager to speak of his family, his mother an illustrator, his father an artisan in the building trades. Nikolas had an older brother but the brother had disappeared, walked out the door one day and never returned; they had no idea where he was, but he had always been a wild lad. Wasn't it strange the way people could disappear, here today and gone tomorrow, without explanation? Yes it was, Lucia said; one more thing that bound her <a id='bliopage141'/>and Nikolas together. Very soon the afternoon movies led to afternoons at Nikolas's studio apartment in Arlington, Mrs. Bazaroff engaged two or three times a week now to look after Mathilde when she returned from school. Relations between Mrs. Bazaroff and Lucia grew chilly and Lucia knew that her trusted neighbor would soon leave them, much as she loved their little girl. But that was a bridge that could be crossed only when arrived at. Even so, Lucia was put off by the older woman's not so subtle expressions of disapproval. She no longer inquired into Lucia's whereabouts nor when she intended to return home, as if neither answer would be the truth. Mrs. Bazaroff was almost a member of the family, having looked after Mathilde since she was an infant. But she had always been partial to Alec.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia was in a vortex she could not control. Not that control was uppermost in her mind; Nikolas was uppermost in her mind. She both did and didn't want to control the vortex. Desire and conscience were at war within her, though war was surely the wrong word because the struggle was undisclosed and unacknowledged, a behind-the-scenes business. As for the covert nature of her affair—what else was she to do? She was a married woman. She had a young daughter. She had to take precautions.</p>
<p class="follow">They came in very high, the aircraft throttled back. The Bernese and the Glarus Alps were visible to the south, their summits glittering in the dawn. Lucia thought she had never seen a sight so beautiful. The Zurichsee was below her, blue as a robin's egg. The aircraft made a wide turn, shuddering, and settled at last into its glide path. The city looked no different to her. She identified the Rudolf Brun Bridge and the Landesmuseum. Everything was as she had left it. She turned from the window and silently prayed that Providence would be kind; things would work out.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">Lucia and Nikolas were trying to arrange a weekend rendezvous when Alec proposed she make the visit to Zurich. Nikolas quickly <a id='bliopage142'/>secured an invitation to lecture at the university, and he and Lucia met there, at a café they both knew well, on the first of October 1970. They spent two hours in the café, drinking coffee, drawing things out, then walked to the pension where Nikolas had booked a room. He asked her right away if there had been any trouble about Mathilde. No, Lucia said, no trouble. And you? Nikolas asked. I am where I want to be, Lucia replied. In Zurich with you. No place else? he asked, teasing her. He had found she teased easily, a temperament thing with the Swiss. But she only laughed and pulled down the sheets of the bed, where they spent the remainder of the morning and most of the afternoon.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">Alec was glad his wife was taking a holiday. She had seemed so down in the dumps, snappish with Mathilde, distant with him. She appeared to have cut off all contact with her émigré friends. The truth was, Lucia was tired and needed a break. Mrs. Bazaroff, with feelings of high foreboding, agreed to stay in the house while Lucia was in Switzerland and Alec on the road with the campaign. She knew what Lucia was up to—Mrs. Bazaroff was not Russian for nothing—and had known for months but had kept her mouth shut. She had never approved of Lucia's friendships with the émigrés, some of whom she knew from her church and the musical evenings she attended. They were a conspiratorial lot, brooding and sly, volatile, great talkers, bone idle. They always knew what was good for you, boulevardier commissars. They also knew, or suspected, that Lucia was involved with Nikolas Janos and so there was talk; rumor piled upon conjecture, the bread and wine of expatriate life. Mrs. Bazaroff grieved for little Mathilde but did not consider it her place to intervene. Mr. Alec would not have believed her anyhow, being fully as credulous as most men. God, what dolts they were, unable to see what was in front of their own eyes. In fact the closer it was, the blinder they were. Mrs. Bazaroff knew things would end badly. How else could they end? Lucia <a id='bliopage143'/>and her layabout paramour were living inside a novel by the hysteric Dostoyevsky where the ending was always predictable. In any case, Alec was destined to be the last to know.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia emptied her bank account—she had been careful over the years and had amassed a sizable nest egg—prudently leaving behind a thousand dollars to keep the account active in the event things didn't work out. She had been taught to leave a little something in reserve for emergencies. But as it happened, things worked out better than she could have imagined. Nikolas was loving and enthusiastic, full of plans, eager to explore Lucia's bohemian Zurich of memory—though he did joke with her that bohemia was difficult to imagine in a city whose devotion to the secret accumulation of great wealth was spiritual in its intensity.</p>
<p class="follow">They took a trip to the Engadine and hiked for a week, putting up at modest rest houses en route. It was at one of the rest houses that Lucia discovered Nikolas's work routine. She was awakened at five <span style="font-size: smaller">A.M.</span> by a murmur, Nikolas talking to himself. She saw him hunched over the small table near the window writing furiously and knew soon enough that the murmur was not speech but the sound of Nikolas's pen racing across the pages, one page after another, and when he finished one he dropped it on the floor. The writer's heavy shoulders strained with the effort, his head bent like a bull preparing its charge. She imagined steam coming from his ears as if his brain was a mighty turbine. Fascinated, she watched him for a quarter-hour. Watched the pages accumulate at his feet. Watched the rhythmic motion of his head. Only once did he pause, his pen raised one foot above the page, and in an instant he was writing again. She closed her eyes, listening to the sound of his pen, the sheet dropping to the floor, a hiss as he drew a fresh sheet from the ream placed to his right at the edge of the table.</p>
<p class="follow">At breakfast the next morning Lucia told him what she had seen.</p>
<p class="follow">I disturbed your sleep! he said.</p>
<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage144'/>I didn't mind, she said. I was fascinated.</p>
<p class="follow">It's the way I go about things, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">I've never seen anything like it, she said. The concentration.</p>
<p class="follow">It's the way Balzac worked, he said. How else do you write eighty novels in thirty years? Plus journalism, sketches, short stories, reviews, personal letters. He was a titan! Nikolas said, loud enough that the people at the next table looked up in alarm. He wrote at night, slept during the day. Wasted eternities in fashionable salons. But even so, the greatest novelist of the nineteenth century. He never wrote a bad book.</p>
<p class="follow">And his love life? Lucia asked.</p>
<p class="follow">He loved women and women loved him.</p>
<p class="follow">He had many women, then.</p>
<p class="follow">Many, many women. There was something preposterous about Balzac, his taste for highborn women, his absurd get-rich-quick schemes. He wanted to import Russian oak for the making of French railway carriages, projects of that kind. None of them panned out, not one. He wanted so to be rich, surrounded by liveried servants and valuable paintings and costly garments and countesses. But at the end he had but one woman, Madame de Hanska, to whom he was completely faithful. She was filthy rich and not good to Balzac. She mocked him. She allowed him to die unattended.</p>
<p class="follow">This is not encouraging, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Read Zweig's biography, Nikolas said. It's all there.</p>
<p class="follow">Stefan Zweig figured in my mother's salon, Lucia said. Not personally. But they were always talking about him.</p>
<p class="follow">And well they might. Another titan. Nikolas signaled for another plate of eggs and a biscuit with jam. More coffee.</p>
<p class="follow">Balzac drank an ocean of coffee each day, Nikolas said. His doctors believed that was one reason he died so young, age fifty-one. Coffee ruined his stomach, and his work habits ruined his heart and mind. Eighty books in just over thirty years. Victor Hugo gave the eulogy.</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage145'/>I have to tell you, Nikolas went on, that Madame de Hanska was lovely whereas Balzac looked like me. Ate like me, too. Nikolas accepted his second helping of eggs with the biscuit on the side. Breakfast concluded, they took a long walk in the mountains. Nikolas was agile for a man of his size. After an hour, Lucia took the lead. They walked along paths and through meadows. As they climbed the air grew chillier.
