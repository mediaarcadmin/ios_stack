<h1 class="chaptertitle">ANDRE</h1>
<p class="left"><b>T</b><span style="font-size: smaller">HEY SAID GOODBYE</span> to Mathilde on the sidewalk under the washed-out sun. She had an appointment at the State Department with her boss and his deputy, unusual for a Saturday afternoon. They were coming in from their homes in the suburbs specifically to discuss the Iran mess, to see Mathilde and learn what she had picked up during her recent rendezvous in Paris. Mathilde smiled apologetically. She really, truly wanted to meet her grandfather but her duty called. Alec listened to this with a sunny smile. His daughter reminded him of his father, always tending to the public's business, scurrying off on weekends to his Senate office for urgent meetings with briefcase-bearing officials, Harry Hopkins or Cordell Hull, and later with Dulles or Herter, and later still with Rusk or Mac Bundy, returning home mildly befuddled and smelling of whiskey. The talks were always urgent. During the Nixon drought he continued to go to his Senate office on Saturday afternoons although he never described the meetings as urgent. Whiskey was involved, however.</p>

<p class="follow">Isn't she wonderful? Lucia said when Mathilde ran off to hail a cab.</p>
<p class="follow">Superb, Alec said. No question.</p>
<p class="follow">Always so full of pep, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">A dynamo, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">She thinks she might get an embassy next year.</p>
<p class="follow">Which one?</p>
<p class="follow">She doesn't know. I think she wants Czech Republic or Hungary. Anyhow some country in central Europe. She wants a country that's struggling with its identity and national purpose. She believes the U.S. has a role to play in those situations. I wanted her to try for Switzerland but she wants no part of Switzerland. She says Switzerland's reserved for political appointments. Moneybags, she calls them.</p>
<p class="follow">Wise child, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Wouldn't it be wonderful, our daughter an ambassador?</p>
<p class="follow">It certainly would be. But she should have gone with us to see her grandfather.</p>
<p class="follow">I don't mind, Lucia said. She has work to do.</p>
<p class="follow">She might learn something about struggling nations.</p>
<p class="follow">I don't like it when you're insincere, Alec.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">Alec looked at the address and directed Lucia out Massachusetts Avenue to Wisconsin, and up Wisconsin to Military Road. It's a few blocks from the intersection, he said. Traffic was heavy and their progress slow. Lucia was silent, lost in thought. The car was warm and Alec yawned, drowsy in the heat; he was unused to wine at lunch. He closed his eyes and wondered if Mathilde had a chance at an embassy. She was overdue for one, though the Czech Republic and Hungary were usually reserved for very senior diplomats or very brilliant younger ones. Well, for all he knew Mathilde was very brilliant. Dealing with the Iranians would be a challenging experience, as you would be obliged to deploy all the witchcraft of diplomacy. You would need a sense of prophecy also, what you would want at the end of it beyond the Iranians' crying uncle. Alec felt himself drift off, aware of the starts and stops, exhaust fumes in the air, not asleep but not awake either. His head was thick with wine, his stomach heavy with steak-frites. If everything went well between Lucia and her father there was no reason for him not to slip away, allow them some privacy. Alec opened his eyes then, aware that someone was speaking, asking him a question. He felt a light hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p class="follow">We're at the intersection, Alec.</p>
<p class="follow">Turn right, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">You fell asleep.</p>
<p class="follow">Wine at lunch, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Are we almost there?</p>
<p class="follow">Turn right again, he said. It's the next block.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia turned into the curb and stopped.</p>
<p class="follow">It's the next block, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">I know, I want to wait a moment. Collect myself.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec was silent, then grunted a laugh. Damnedest thing, he said. I've forgotten your father's name.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre, Lucia said, Andre Duran.</p>
<p class="follow">I remember the Duran part, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">I have no recollection of him at all, Lucia said. If he poked his head in the car this minute I'd have no idea who he was, I don't know why he's called, all these years. What does he want with me? She drummed her fingers on the steering wheel and stared straight ahead. What does he have in his mind?</p>
<p class="follow">They were parked in a residential neighborhood, large Victorian houses with detached garages, shade trees either side of the road. Alec did not know the neighborhood, and looking at it now he thought it belonged in a small town somewhere, Iowa or Indiana. Doctors and lawyers lived on the street. You could believe the prairie began beyond the next street, section after section of soybeans or corn. The houses were well maintained and several had old-fashioned TV antennas fixed to the chimneys. The sidewalks were empty. When Alec rolled down the window he heard swing music coming from one of the houses. He listened appreciatively for a moment, then realized it was sound-over for a commercial. He closed his eyes once more, waiting for Lucia.</p>
<p class="follow">He would be a little over ninety years old, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">I think we ought to get on with it, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Give me just a minute.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm surprised your husband didn't come with you.</p>
<p class="follow">Nikolas was busy. A lecture in Budapest.</p>
<p class="follow">Even so, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">He has his work, Alec. Just as you used to.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec opened the car door and stepped out.</p>
<p class="follow">Where are you going? Lucia said, alarm in her voice.</p>
<p class="follow">Nowhere, Alec said. I need some air.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia's hand went to her mouth. I thought you were fed up with me, she said, and decided to jump ship. Have done with all this.</p>
<p class="follow">I just need some air, Lucia.</p>
<p class="follow">I wouldn't blame you, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">Don't worry about it.</p>
<p class="follow">Thank you for helping me, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">Sure, Alec said. He looked up, focusing his bad eye on the telephone wires that split this way and that as he looked at them. Munch-lines, he thought of them, getting worse each time he checked. But his head was clearing and his stomach was settled nicely. He surveyed the street once more and checked his watch, three-thirty. In the big house on the corner an upstairs curtain moved, someone worried about strange cars in the neighborhood. He heard the bark of a dog.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm ready now, Alec.</p>
<p class="follow">Let's go, he said and got in the car.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">They parked across the street from number 1007, a stone pile three stories high with a square-cut widow's walk with a railing on top. It was the house of a banker or a newspaper publisher, perhaps a merchant prince of the previous century or the century before that. The house looked to have eight or nine bedrooms at least—they had large families in those days—each bedroom window fitted with its own slatted shutters. Lucia said the house looked like something you might find in a suburb of Prague or Berlin, solid, built to last. The shutters were painted flat black. The widow's walk was white and even from a distance it was evident the structure was in bad repair, dangerous footing for a widow or anyone else who ventured there. Alec explained to Lucia that it was a design of the sort found in whaling villages like Edgartown or Nantucket, a place for the woman of the house to stand staring out to sea, expecting her absent captain from his voyage to the South Seas or the North Atlantic.</p>
<p class="follow">They'd be gone two, three years, he said. Often they didn't come home. That's why it's called a widow's walk.</p>
<p class="follow">But the sea isn't anywhere near Washington, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">It's a decoration, he said. Either that or the merchant prince had it built for his wife, expecting her to wait there each evening for his return from the countinghouse downtown. A round of applause when he drove up in the Pierce-Arrow.</p>
<p class="follow">Please. What is a Pierce-Arrow?</p>
<p class="follow">Expensive car, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Two giant oaks stood left and right of the sidewalk leading up to the porch steps and the front door. The covered porch ran around the front and sides of the house, a glider positioned to the right of the front door. Wisteria clung to the porch railing. No one was about. It took Alec a moment to notice the small sign on the front lawn. Grass had grown up around it. The sign read, in Gothic script, <em>Goya House.</em></p>
<p class="follow">They walked slowly up the sidewalk and the steps leading to the porch. There was no bell to push or knocker to rap. He told Lucia to wait and he walked from one window to another, looking inside at a large room filled with chairs and a sofa and tables piled high with newspapers and magazines, many of them from abroad. When Alec turned the corner he stopped short and signaled Lucia to join him.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec said, I think that's your father.</p>
<p class="follow">He was dressed in dark slacks and a white tunic, leather sandals on his bare feet, smoking a cigarette in an ivory holder, the ivory stained brown by nicotine. He was seated in a rocking chair, gently moving back and forth while he smoked and watched a squirrel collect acorns on the lawn. Andre Duran—for it was indisputably him, his features a rough cut of Lucia's, his tight smile identical to his daughter's when she was in repose—did not acknowledge their presence. The resemblance ended there. He was built like a wrestler and looked like one, with his crew-cut iron-gray hair, gnarled forehead, and heavy hands and arms. For all that he presented an air of authority, some combination of civil and military rank, accustomed to issuing orders and having them obeyed. He looked younger than ninety years old, but that did not imply that his life had been easy. Alec noticed that the hand that held the cigarette holder was missing its little finger. Andre Duran had not heard them approach and Alec thought that odd until he saw the hearing aid in his ear. Behind him, Alec heard Lucia's quick intake of breath.</p>
<p class="follow">She stood in front of him and said, Hello, Papa.</p>
<p class="follow">He looked up sharply, annoyed at being disturbed. But his face softened at once and he said, Oh, Lucia. You've come to see me.</p>
<p class="follow">He took her hands, smiling broadly, and began what seemed to be a speech. He spoke in a deep voice that rose and fell with emotion. He was moving his hands up and down, her fingers disappearing into his fists. He talked on and on, all of it in Czech. His expressions went from high delight to despair and back again. Andre Duran was evidently telling a story, some version of his life, how he had lived his days, where all the years had gone, the places he had lived and how he had thought all this time of his daughter but was unable to communicate with her. The incomprehensible words flew by. Lucia moved once to interrupt him but he was having none of it, shaking his huge head and speaking in a kind of growl, struggling to condense and intensify his life's journey. All this time he was looking at Lucia as if she were some miraculous incarnation of a fairy princess, come to rescue him from his own memory. She opened her mouth to interrupt him again but he paid no attention. His eyes were far away, back somewhere in his youth or early middle age. He went on and on until at last he rapped his knuckles on the window, releasing her hands as he did so.</p>
<p class="follow">Papa, I don't speak Czech.</p>
<p class="follow">That can't be true, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">I did speak it. But I lost it after Mama died.</p>
<p class="follow">You speak no Czech?</p>
<p class="follow">Only a few words, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">I was saying how happy I am to see you.</p>
<p class="follow">I understood that, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">I have wanted to say those words for a very long time.</p>
<p class="follow">I understood that, too. We can speak German if you wish. Or French.</p>
<p class="follow">No German, he said dismissively. No French. His eyes moved sideways to make a quick glance at Alec, ignored these many minutes. Alec was not certain he had been noticed at all, so rapt was Andre Duran in his daughter.</p>
<p class="follow">This is Alec, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">They shook hands, calluses on soft flesh.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec is Mathilde's father.</p>
<p class="follow">Who is Mathilde?</p>
<p class="follow">Your granddaughter, Papa.</p>
<p class="follow">He looked around him. Where is she? Is she here?</p>
<p class="follow">She had an appointment, Lucia said. She works for the State Department—</p>
<p class="follow">The American State Department?—</p>
<p class="follow">And she is there now for a meeting.</p>
<p class="follow">What meeting?</p>
<p class="follow">I don't know. A meeting of the sort diplomats have.</p>
<p class="follow">Is she talking about me?</p>
<p class="follow">You? No, not you. I think it has to do with the Iranians.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre considered that a moment and turned to rap once more on the window.</p>
<p class="follow">Please, he said. Sit.</p>
<p class="follow">There were wicker chairs at the far end of the porch. Alec fetched them and he and Lucia sat. Lucia began to speak of Mathilde, where she had gone to school and university and what she did for the State Department. Lucia spoke slowly so her father could fully understand. Mathilde had had postings in Europe and Africa and was now in the political section of the London embassy. She was hoping to be nominated ambassador next year. She wanted a central European country, Czech Republic or Hungary. But if not central Europe then farther east, one of the breakaway republics of the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="follow">And what is the attraction of these countries?</p>
<p class="follow">Mathilde calls them serious countries, Lucia said. They are countries struggling with their identity and national purpose and how they organize themselves, and in these circumstances America has a role to play, advising. How to write a constitution. How to organize a judiciary. Formulate a foreign policy. Control the military. She looked to Alec for help but Alec said nothing. This was the first he had heard of the breakaway republics of the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre grunted a mirthless laugh.</p>
<p class="follow">Mathilde was unmarried, Lucia said, taking the conversation in another, theoretically safer, direction. She was a wonderful student as a child and now she was married to her work, an excellent diplomat, gifted with languages, wonderful at negotiation. People speak so highly of her, Papa. We are very proud that she works for the government. Alec's father was a senator—here, Andre turned to look quizzically at Alec—so it is a family affair. Alec watched Lucia as she spoke, leaning forward, moving her hands like an orchestra conductor. She and her father had the same gestures, though neither of them seemed to notice; the effect was of a nervous companionability, two friends striving to catch up and not knowing where to begin. Lucia was talking rapidly, her words tumbling one after another. She had stared intently at her father when they met, and Alec knew she was remembering her mother's photograph of the young man at the café table in Prague wearing a Borsalino and smoking a cigarette, the best-looking man in the room. She was trying to fit the portrait to the aged man in the rocking chair, the one listening hard to each word she said. Alec wondered where he found the ivory cigarette holder, an accessory as well worn as a billfold or a pair of slippers.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre turned to Alec. Do you think she will be ambassador to Czech Republic?</p>
<p class="follow">No, Alec said. That's a post for a senior diplomat.</p>
<p class="follow">Hungary?</p>
<p class="follow">I would say the same.</p>
<p class="follow">But we're hoping, Lucia said brightly.</p>
<p class="follow">Be careful what you hope for, Andre said. And now we will have coffee.</p>
<p class="follow">A sullen teenage boy arrived carrying a brass platter of tiny cups and saucers and a pot of Turkish coffee. Andre rapped on the window and said something to the boy, who shrugged and put the tray on the floor and departed. He returned in a moment with a wooden table, placed the tray on it, and went away, this time for good. Andre's eyes were on him the whole while, as if he expected the boy to pilfer a spoon. At last Andre sighed and poured Turkish coffee, the consistency of mud but aromatic. Alec took a cup but Lucia declined. Andre nodded and with great concentration lit another cigarette, screwing it into his ivory holder. He carefully balanced the tiny cup of coffee on the arm of his rocking chair and sat back watching the squirrel forage for acorns on the lawn. Alec had the idea that this was an afternoon ritual, no hurry because Andre had no place to go. Conversation was suspended while Andre watched the squirrel, the picture of bourgeois contentment. A wire of cigarette smoke rose in the heavy air.</p>
<p class="follow">Are you comfortable here, Papa?</p>
<p class="follow">Oh, yes. Quite comfortable.</p>
<p class="follow">But—can you tell me. Why are you here?</p>
<p class="follow">It was arranged for me.</p>
<p class="follow">This place?</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, it's run by people I knew at one time. It's a boarding house for refugees, stateless people or people who consider themselves stateless. People who have no place else to go. Goya House is a kind of way station, a port of call, quite comfortable and agreeable except for that lad who brought the coffee. He wants a good whipping, insolent little beggar. They have no manners, the young. But he makes good coffee.</p>
<p class="follow">And have you been here a long time?</p>
<p class="follow">At least two years, he said. More than that, I think. It's easy to lose track of time in America.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec smiled at that, suddenly enjoying himself, listening to Andre dole out his precious bits of information. Alec liked listening to his antique English, <em>insolent liddle beggah,</em> inflected with Czech and God knows what other languages from middle Europe and beyond. Andre had begun to rock again, the cigarette holder clamped between his teeth and his fingers securing the coffee cup, an untroubled ship's captain in full command of his vessel.</p>
<p class="follow">It's a very large house, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, well. Andre smiled. The money came from an industrialist who made a fortune in the war. Dry goods, I believe. He died a very pleasant sinner's death in the south of France. He and his son were estranged but he left the boy his fortune nevertheless, and the boy gave it away to these people I knew at one time. They wanted to name the place after their benefactor but the son would have none of it. He insisted they call it Goya House, having in mind <em>The Disasters of War.</em></p>

<p class="follow">Goodness, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">The young man hated his father but he did have a sense of humor. Goya has another meaning, popular in the American army. Get Off Your Ass.</p>
<p class="follow">The industrialist was American? Alec asked.</p>
<p class="follow">German, Andre said. Through and through.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia said, You certainly look well.</p>
<p class="follow">I am in good health, Andre said. Against all odds.</p>
<p class="follow">But Papa. Where were you before? Where have you been living? All this time we thought you were dead.</p>
<p class="follow">No, I wasn't dead. Where did you get that idea?</p>
<p class="follow">That's what Mama said.</p>
<p class="follow">Your mother was a romantic. I imagine she was repeating something she had been told.</p>
<p class="follow">She believed it. And so did I.</p>
<p class="follow">Loose talk, Andre said. People talk too much.</p>
<p class="follow">And we heard nothing to the contrary, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Conditions were not ideal, Andre said after a long pause. Those were terrible times. Hard to make sense of them even now. They are hard to describe. There was confusion, a mare's nest of half-truth and innuendo. Andre raised his head and made a tick-tick-tick sound, looking at the squirrel, which froze, an acorn between its busy teeth. Neither Andre nor the squirrel moved for a heartbeat or two. Andre took a sip of his coffee, a motion that seemed to break the spell, if that was what it was. Andre blew a series of smoke rings and the squirrel returned to its acorn.</p>
<p class="follow">We had no reason not to believe it, Lucia said. In the absence of other news, Mama believed it.</p>
<p class="follow">Communication was difficult, that's true.</p>
<p class="follow">I met a man years ago at a party in Washington, Lucia said. His name was Kryg, an ambassador—</p>
<p class="follow">Kryg! Andre said, and began to laugh, this time with sincerity.</p>
<p class="follow">He told me he had seen you in Trieste.</p>

<p class="follow">It was not Trieste. I have forgotten where it was but it wasn't Trieste.</p>
<p class="follow">Kryg was also vague about the date. He was vague about everything, and I believe he regretted saying he had seen you. But he said you were in business. I told him he didn't know what he was talking about, you alive and in business in Trieste. He was quite taken aback. He apologized. He said he had to speak to me because we, you and I, looked so much alike. He knew I was your daughter before he knew my name.</p>
<p class="follow">Kryg was always unreliable, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">So you did meet him.</p>
<p class="follow">Kryg and I met on and off for years, Andre said. I'd see him here and there. Andre paused a moment, lost in thought. And strictly speaking he was no more unreliable than many ambassadors. He was a shrimp. Came up to my shoulder. But he was not a fool. By no means a fool. The time was difficult, as I said. Difficult for me and for everyone else. So we had a conversation. I needed money and he gave me the money I asked for. It wasn't much.</p>
<p class="follow">Why didn't you let us know?</p>
<p class="follow">Know what? Andre seemed genuinely puzzled by the question.</p>
<p class="follow">That you were alive, Papa.</p>
<p class="follow">The time was not convenient, dear Lucia.</p>
<p class="follow">I don't understand, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre smiled sympathetically. He said, Now I would like it if you would tell me what happened after you left Prague, all the details. I know you and your mother lived in Zurich and she taught at the university. Tell me of your life there.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec rose then and asked directions to the men's room. Without taking his eyes off Lucia, Andre said it was on the first floor, second door right. Knock first. Alec wandered off as Lucia began her Zurich saga, events familiar to him. He found the men's room unoccupied and pissed for what seemed a minute or more. In the living room once again he glanced at the foreign newspapers and magazines and the framed posters on the wall, posters of Budapest and Sarajevo, Kraków, Sofia, and New York. They were ordinary travel posters of the sort found in airport waiting rooms, cheerful scenes of picturesque squares and cathedrals, cafés in bright sunlight, the Statue of Liberty. Alec looked through the window at Andre listening to Lucia. From the few phrases he could hear, he knew she was telling him of her mother's salon, who was there and what was discussed, the arguments, her mother a kind of impresario of intellectuals. She was so beautiful, my mother, Lucia said. Everyone admired her. She believed in socialism until the very end. I think everyone loved her and when she died Zurich was a poorer place. Of course she always considered herself Czech.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre hardly moved during this recitation. By now he had lit a fresh cigarette, and when Lucia waved her hand to deflect the smoke he seemed not to notice, for he immediately took a deep drag and released it in a thin stream. Alec was conscious of the thick silence inside Goya House and wondered whether Andre was the only tenant and the liddle beggah the only worker. He moved quietly to the doorway and took his seat on the porch as Lucia was winding down her tale, her years in Washington and her subsequent move to Zurich and then to Prague with a new husband. She stopped there because she was much more interested in her father's story than her own story, and she had not gotten far with him.</p>
<p class="follow">Nikolas Janos, Lucia concluded, and fell silent.</p>
<p class="follow">Why do I know the name? Andre asked.</p>
<p class="follow">He writes novels, Lucia said. Wonderful novels.</p>
<p class="follow">Oh, yes. I read one of them.</p>
<p class="follow">He is very successful, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">He is of the new generation, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia smiled at that. Not anymore, Papa. There are two generations behind him. And one still in front.</p>

<p class="follow">I used to have a beautiful library.</p>
<p class="follow">What happened to it, Papa?</p>
<p class="follow">It was lost, he said. He turned to Alec and said, Did you find the toilet?</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="follow">We are very quiet here today. Everyone has gone to the soccer.</p>
<p class="follow">But not you, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">I have never cared for sport except skiing.</p>
<p class="follow">Do you ski, Papa?</p>
<p class="follow">I have always skied. I started skiing when I was six.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia was a skier, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">And then I broke my leg, Lucia said. I still ski but not seriously. When I broke my leg I thought my heart would break. I thought my life was over so I came to America.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec gave her a look of surprise. He had never heard that.</p>
<p class="follow">And you, Alec, Andre said, what is your sport?</p>
<p class="follow">Alec said, Sailing.</p>
<p class="follow">I myself am an inland man, Andre said. I do not care for the sea.</p>
<p class="follow">It can be a dangerous place, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm sure, Andre said with a smile. If I may ask, what is your business?</p>
<p class="follow">Photography, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">There are many sides to photography. What is your side?</p>
<p class="follow">Alec was silent a moment. He never knew how to answer the question. He supposed by "side" Andre meant "subject." But Alec had many subjects. He said, I suppose I prefer photographing actors onstage, preferably in rehearsal. I believe they are most natural when playing a role. Also, I like their company. He explained that he favored repetition, his garden and sailing vessels in the Chesapeake Bay. Over the years he had photographed landscapes, seascapes, cityscapes, bowls of fruit, baseball infields, and the heavens, along with the actors.</p>

<p class="follow">I started out with news, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">Automobile accidents? Andre asked.</p>
<p class="follow">Once or twice, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">I watch the television in the evening and they seem most interested in automobile accidents and murder.</p>
<p class="follow">No murders, Alec said. We weren't that kind of paper.</p>
<p class="follow">Politicians?</p>
<p class="follow">Oh, yes, many politicians. The paper was interested in politics above all else. The politician with his wife, the politician with his children, the politician campaigning. But never asleep. The politician never sleeps. Andre was looking at him with a sly smile and Alec saw at once that he had misunderstood the question. He returned the smile and said, Of course a murdered politician would be news.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre considered that, and then he said, War?</p>
<p class="follow">The paper was interested in war, Alec said. Vietnam and the wars that came after. Andre looked at him with an amused expression and Alec felt that he was being led into troubled terrain. He said, I mean Somalia and the Balkans and Iraq One and now Iraq Two. One of our people was badly wounded just last year. He wondered at his use of the word "our" because he had not worked for the paper for almost forty years. He said, The Iraq War is the biggest story in the world.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre said, Did you go?</p>
<p class="follow">I was out of the newspaper by then. They asked me to go to Vietnam but I said no. Lucia and I were still married then. We had Mathilde. I didn't see the point. I told them that photography glorified the war. Vietnam was not my business.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, Andre said mildly, I can see that.</p>
<p class="follow">I think he did it for me, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Not entirely, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, I'm certain of it, Lucia said, looking at her father who did not appear to be listening. His face seemed set in stone. His eyes were closed. I remember the conversation, she said.</p>

<p class="follow">Very different, Andre said, and fell silent, extracting another cigarette from the pack at his elbow and screwing it into the holder. He struck a match and resumed contemplation of the squirrel, now burrowing near the privet hedge that bordered the lawn. The sun was disappearing and lights winked on in the houses around the neighborhood. An elderly couple strolled by and they and Andre exchanged waves. The woman said something and Andre laughed and gave her a thumbs-up. My favorite time of day absolutely, Andre said, and blew a fat smoke ring.</p>
<p class="follow">I remember the conversation very well, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Hush, Lucia, her father said.</p>
<p class="follow">My opinion, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">In error, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">You two, Andre said, stop bickering. Enjoy the evening.</p>
<p class="follow">What difference does it make? he added.</p>
<p class="follow">A moment passed, the sky continuing to darken. Alec said, You were in the war.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, of course. Everyone was. You had no choice. Even if you wanted to make a choice there was no choice.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia asked her father where he had fought.</p>
<p class="follow">Central Europe, he said. All over.</p>
<p class="follow">Whose army, Papa?</p>
<p class="follow">The partisan army, he said. We operated in Yugoslavia and beyond. I suppose you would call us irregulars. We were not under normal military discipline. We fought where we felt like fighting, mostly in the mountains. It seems to me in those years that it was always winter, snow, frostbite. You would wake up in the morning and the water in your canteen was frozen stiff. I have no memory of the summer or spring. I have no memory of the month of May or the month of July. We went where the opportunities were. A bridge that needed to be taken down, a section of railroad track, a munitions depot. When we came upon a German patrol we would engage it and we were usually successful. We chose carefully. The fascists chose carefully also in their reprisals, whole villages taken out and shot without pity. A mayor hanged. A farmer's wife raped in front of her children and her husband. There is an obvious abnormality here, an imbalance I should say, but we chose to ignore it. For the most part they were not our villages, our mayor, or our farmer's wife. As a consequence we were not admired by the local population. Instead we were feared, even hated. So we moved as often as possible, fighting on the run. And we took many casualties but there were always young men prepared to join up. I daresay among the young men there was a romance about us. The romance was at a distance. Up close we were not the young woman of your dreams but the witch of your nightmares. Our idea was your Lincoln's idea: save the Union. And that was reduced to a single mission: kill the fascists. Nothing else mattered. So we did what we could, badly equipped until the end. At the end, there was plenty of German ordnance to choose from. The Germans were beautifully equipped. Leather boots and gloves, warm greatcoats, superb weapons. Snow gear. Even their skis were professional quality, made in Switzerland as I remember. We looted the dead. And then we moved in a direction we should not have moved in. Our intelligence was faulty and it is all but certain that there was a betrayal. In any case we outran ourselves. It's often the way with an irregular army, filled with confidence and the elation that comes with it. We thought the fascists were fini shed. We thought we were untouchable. So we got careless. We did not take elementary precautions. We heard rumors of an Allied landing in North Africa so we believed we were at the endgame. By God we had given them a bloody nose, but that's all it was, a bloody nose. In our confidence and elation we decided to attack one of their headquarters and they just beat the hell out of us with tanks and heavy artillery and more infantry than we thought possible. Fresh troops, well trained, disciplined. Where did they come from? I don't know. They were waiting for us and it was all over in under an hour.</p>

<p class="follow">But you escaped, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Captured, Andre corrected. I was sent to a fascist prison camp in Poland. We were there two years. We were liberated, if you want to call it that, by the Red Army. And then we were sent to a camp in the Soviet Union. Andre was silent again, the only sound the creak of his rocker.</p>
<p class="follow">The German camp, Lucia began.</p>
<p class="follow">I will not speak of the German camp, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">Oh, Papa, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">They were swine, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">There has been too much talk already of the German camps. I can add nothing to what has been said and written. I have no interest in going over it again. Do you understand?</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, Papa.</p>
<p class="follow">Good, Andre said. But I will tell you about the Russian camp if you wish.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, Lucia said. Of course.</p>
<p class="follow">We were sent to a camp in the Soviet Union. It was south of Murmansk. I wasn't sure where it was located precisely. I'm still not sure. My papers, such as they were, had been lost. They had no idea who I was, only that I was not Russian. I tried to tell them that I was one of them, a loyal communist. Had been a communist since the Nazis overran Sudetenland. They didn't believe me. They thought I was a fascist trickster and the unit I led, the one that was not strictly speaking under discipline, a gang of hooligans. Bandits. And it was true, we lived off the land while we fought the Wehrmacht. We took what we wanted when we wanted it. We tried never to lose sight of our Lincoln ideal, kill the fascists where they stood. That was in first position and everything else in second position. So they took us for bandits or maybe only revisionists. I never knew for certain. There was no trial. There was no due process, as the Americans like to say. The commissars made a decision and the decision was final. Three men and a woman in one small room in the headquarters section of the German camp. Fifteen, maybe twenty minutes. They allowed a one-minute statement from me, in Czech, which none of them spoke. One day I was in Poland and a few months later I was in the Soviet Union, in the camp south of Murmansk. By then I was separated from my commando. We were transported in cattle cars, Hungarians, Bulgarians, some Czechs, even a Swiss, all charged with various crimes. Or simply "detained." The train never reached a speed of more than twenty kilometers an hour, with long stops along the way. Food and water were short. Men fell sick and died. Everything stank. During the long stops the guards dismounted and stood along the siding, jokes, laughter, the smell of tobacco.</p>
<p class="follow">I can't listen, Lucia said. I can't hear any more of this.</p>
<p class="follow">But Andre did not hear her. Still, he said, it was spring. A cold spring but spring nonetheless. It was an improvement over what we had. In due course we arrived at the camp. There, it was not yet spring. Snow was on the ground and I remember thinking that it would be there forever. Snow as far as my eye could see, gray snow, snow the color of a dirty sheet. Andre shook his head heavily. Well, he said, enough of that.</p>
<p class="follow">He rose suddenly, surprisingly agile for so large a man. He stretched his arms wide as if embracing the night and pitched his cigarette on the lawn where it bounced in a little shower of sparks. He looked around him and then he rapped again on the window. The boy appeared at once.</p>
<p class="follow">Schnapps, Andre said. Three glasses. Have one yourself.</p>
<p class="follow">Right away, the boy said, and hurried off.</p>
<p class="follow">He's better at night, Andre said. His manners come back to him at night because he knows very well that I'll give him a glass.</p>
<p class="follow">Bring the bottle, Andre said loudly.</p>
<p class="follow">Thank God you're here, Papa.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, I'm comfortable.</p>
<p class="follow">It's a nice house.</p>

<p class="follow">Adequate, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">I didn't know what to expect, Lucia said. But Papa, what do you do here?</p>
<p class="follow">Do? I don't understand.</p>
<p class="follow">Your life, day to day.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre shrugged. The question had no meaning for him.</p>
<p class="follow">I mean, Lucia began.</p>
<p class="follow">I am happy to be alive. In good health. I enjoy my Turkish coffee, my schnapps. In the evening I often play cards. He smiled broadly. I suppose I have always looked for the absolute, Andre said.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">Night came in a rush. The street was suddenly busy with arrival and departure. Somewhere nearby a dog barked and an infant began to cry. The tray that held the coffee now held a bottle of schnapps and three delicately etched glasses. Lucia was certain the glasses were Czech made, the works at Zelezny Brod. Andre poured three glasses of schnapps and sat back again in his rocking chair, another cigarette in the ivory holder. Lucia watched her father fill the schnapps glass in his hand, the one that was missing the little finger. He appeared the picture of contentment, a man at ease in the world, lost in thought now. His thoughts, whatever they were, looked to be pleasant, for he was smiling.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia had the idea he was thinking of her mother, dead so many years. They must have had a tremendous romance before he went away and disappeared, dead in her mother's eyes. She wondered when his birthday was. She would ask him the date and buy him a Borsalino as a present. She would invite him to Prague and take him to a fine café for lunch. Nikolas, too. They would have a sumptuous lunch with wine and schnapps to finish. He and Nikolas would like each other. She heard them discussing the literature of central Europe, Zweig, Kafka, Walter Benjamin. Perhaps Nikolas could get him to talk about the camps and how he survived. She wondered if there were any women in his life. Andre looked twenty years younger than his age. Everyone said she did, too. Alec looked exactly his age, seventy years old; or was he now seventy-one? She couldn't remember. Alec didn't look well. His face had a kind of pallor and he shuffled when he walked, like an old man. His eyesight was failing and he still wouldn't answer a direct question. Lucia wondered if he was still seeing his Hollywood star, though "star" was far too generous a term. She had never been a star, merely a competent second lead. Mathilde told her that whatshername mostly acted in made-for-television movies of the policier variety, cops-and-robbers business. Well. Whatever made him happy.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia had so many questions to ask her father. She didn't know where to begin and she didn't want to sound like an inquisitor giving him the third degree. So far he had been forthcoming. She had hated telling him that she no longer spoke Czech or enough Czech to follow a complicated story. She saw the dismay on his face and heard it in his voice. She remembered her mother telling her she would never lose her essential Czechness. But it seemed she had. She couldn't imagine what was in her mind when she told Alec she needed protection. She didn't need protection, and if she had needed it Alec was not the man for the job. She had been with her father only an hour and she felt as if she had known him her entire life. Now she watched him roll the schnapps glass in his hand and take a swallow, still smiling at whatever thought or memory was occupying his mind.</p>
<p class="follow">When did you lose your finger, Papa?</p>
<p class="follow">Years ago, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">In the war?</p>
<p class="follow">Andre looked at the stump. He said, When I was a child. My father and I were chopping wood. I lost control of my ax. It was only a child's ax but sharp all the same and I wasn't paying attention. Instead I was watching my father to see how he used his ax. My father was a fine woodsman and knew all the tricks. I remember that he went chalk white when he saw the blood, but he picked me up and carried me the mile or so to our house. My mother was furious with him. There was a terrible row between the two of them, my mother yelling at my father like he was trash. She ordered him from the house while she wrapped my hand. My mother took me to the doctor's office herself in our horse-drawn cart, refusing to allow him to come along. Of course I felt responsible for their argument. All the way to the doctor's office my mother repeated over and over again, Idiot, Your father is an idiot, your father is an incompetent. I knew that wasn't true. He only turned his back at the wrong time. And I was careless. I promised myself never to be careless after that. A valuable lesson, Lucia. It saved me much grief later on. A small price to pay, one finger, for the lesson.</p>
<p class="follow">Does it bother you now?</p>
<p class="follow">Sometimes when the weather is clammy it aches, he said and resumed his watch of the street.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia wanted to ask him how badly it hurt at the time. Probably his wound was worse even than her ski accident. She remembered the pain coming in waves, each wave larger than the one before until she passed out. She took his hand then, so heavy, heavy in her palm. She turned it this way and that, looking at the finger stump. The stump skin was waxy, slippery to the touch. She said, It's hardly noticeable. If that happened today they'd find a way to sew the finger onto your hand. And then you would be whole again.</p>
<p class="follow">I never notice it, Andre said. You learn to live without.</p>
<p class="follow">I never got over my leg, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre nodded in the darkness, then turned to Alec. Have you ever been injured?</p>
<p class="follow">Alec thought a moment and said, No.</p>
<p class="follow">No broken bones ever? No wounds?</p>
<p class="follow">I have led a fortunate life, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">I would say so, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">But I am losing my eyesight. Would that qualify?</p>
<p class="follow">I don't think so, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">Why are we talking about injuries? Alec asked.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia mentioned them, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">Losing one's eyesight is a painless injury, Alec said. Even the effects of it are painless. Inconvenient, but painless. It's painful thinking of the future without eyesight but that's not pain of a physical sort. Alec finished his glass of schnapps and poured another. I have never been in prison, either. I have trouble imagining what it's like locked up, one day following another without much distinction between them.</p>
<p class="follow">The distinctions are small, that's true, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">The weather, I suppose. The task at hand.</p>
<p class="follow">The monotony, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">Trying to imagine what's over the horizon?</p>
<p class="follow">I suppose so, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec sipped schnapps and wondered aloud if one single thing from the experience was—and he could not summon the correct word. Elevating? Convincing?</p>
<p class="follow">The disappearance of one's friends, Andre said, often without explanation, and then days later the rumors begin. So-and-so was transferred. Had a heart attack. Was found dead in bed by his own hand, or another's hand. Was taken away and shot. The Stalin years were the worst. Later on, discipline relaxed a little. The food improved. The weather never improved. Andre screwed another cigarette into his holder and lit it, allowing the match to burn down to his fingertips. It was difficult keeping one's senses in such an atmosphere. You became unnaturally aware of your own body, the lost weight, your bones visible beneath the skin. Rotting teeth. Obscure pains that came and went. Sexual desire went into hiding. It had to be there somewhere but you could not locate it. The absent-minded man lost the keys to his car and no amount of wishing or recollection brought them back. Your situation was ludicrous. Absurd. And unfathomable. In a sense inscrutable. Of course those were not the words you used then. They came later when nutrition had improved and you were able to think clearly, relatively speaking. Make an assessment of where you were and how you had come to be there and what might happen next. That is to say, think about the future. I cannot tell you what a luxury that was, conceiving the future. It was the equivalent of imagining yourself in a wonderful café somewhere in the company of close friends, everyone laughing. Someone is telling a story. A policeman walks by and smiles because everyone is having such a good time. You begin to wonder if at some unspecified date in the future they will let you out. Decide that you are harmless after all. Not a threat to the state. Not a threat to anyone. Perhaps conclude that a mistake has been made, a bureaucratic blunder, understandable in wartime. No hard feelings.</p>
<p class="follow">I don't want to hear any more, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre filled his glass and Alec's. Lucia's was untouched but he poured a little anyway, absent-mindedly, minding his manners.</p>
<p class="follow">Please go on, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia doesn't wish it, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">I don't like to think of you in prison, Papa.</p>
<p class="follow">Well, he said, I was released. Many weren't.</p>
<p class="follow">What did they tell you when they released you? Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">That I had served my sentence and that I was free to go.</p>
<p class="follow">No explanations?</p>
<p class="follow">None asked, none given. They gave me some money and put me on a train to Prague. When the train reached its terminus I got off. That was all there was to it. End of story.</p>
<p class="follow">Just like that, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">I had been ill, Andre said. They had finally allowed me to see the camp doctor, who said I had pneumonia and must enter the hospital at once. Except there were no unoccupied beds so my admittance was delayed, and when they found space for me I was hallucinating. My fever was high. Tremendously high. The drugs on hand were few and not altogether potent. I don't know how long I was in the hospital. Weeks certainly, all that time either comatose or hallucinating. Sweating, then chills. In my delirium I conjured fantastic visions, the gardens of Bosch and Dali's melting clocks. And when I woke it was to the solemn colorless interior of the pneumonia ward. My God it was cold in the ward, only one small brazier fire at one end of a long dark room, cots along both walls. One sheet and one thin blanket. But I refused to die. That was what the doctor told me—he, too, was a prisoner so he knew what he was talking about. The offer was made and I refused. I have always had a strong constitution. So I improved, and as I improved I began to think about the world I had made for myself. I knew I had fallen behind in life, all those years in camps, and my own actions had brought me there, no matter how unjustly my actions were judged by the authorities. I had to account somehow for the lost years and began to rationalize them in this way. They were like one's infancy and early boyhood, call it the years from birth to age six or seven. One has scant memory of those years, and the memories one does have are trivial unless there's drama of one sort or another, a death in the family, an earthquake, something of that nature. Of course I had been in prison a very long time but still I could think of the years as childhood years when not much is recollected. God knows there was little enough to recollect from the monotony of captivity. Prison is more a process of forgetting than remembering. I was not ashamed of the acts that had brought me first to Poland and then to the Soviet Union. I would not change anything except naturally there were acts of cruelty and indifference during the war. I regret those acts but I am not ashamed of them. They are war's signature, cruelty and indifference. War has its own rules, handed down through the centuries. So I lay in my hospital bed and improved and improved some more and when I had improved enough they released me. And a month or so after that I was let go altogether, given some money and a train ticket and another man's suit of clothes. <em>Do svidanya.</em> No hard feelings.</p>
<p class="follow">Now you must excuse me a moment, Andre said, setting aside his schnapps and stepping inside the house, leaving Alec and Lucia alone in the darkness and neighborly silence of a suburban street.</p>
<p class="follow">All those years in prison, Lucia said. I wonder if he ever thought of my mother and me. Wondered what had happened to us.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm sure he did, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">He didn't say he did, Lucia said in a small voice. He mentioned Bosch and Dali. His pneumonia. Many other things. Not us.</p>
<p class="follow">An oversight, Alec said. But he was not interested in what Andre did or did not recollect of his wife and daughter, safe in neutral Switzerland. Andre had said, I knew I had fallen behind in life. What did that mean? He had fought bravely in the war and been imprisoned first by the Nazis and then by the Soviets for what appeared to be decades and his assessment was that he had "fallen behind in life"? That was true as far as it went but it did not go nearly far enough. Andre seemed to bear his captors no real rancor, and that was hard to believe. History had swallowed him up, then spit him out. His voice was gruff but colored also by irony, a psychic detachment, as if the appalling events had happened to someone else. In a literal sense he seemed to stand apart from his own circumstances. Alec was all but overcome with admiration for Andre Duran, whose endurance seemed to him all but superhuman. He was a courageous man. Andre had regret, he said, but no shame over what he had done. He had merely obeyed war's rules. "Merely." Alec was in no position to judge. He wondered if there were photographs of Andre in the war and later in the camps, and if the photographs, if they existed, would add anything important to the story. Certainly they would not add glamour.</p>
<p class="follow">It would not have been an oversight, Alec.</p>
<p class="follow">That was a joke, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">I don't like jokes at this time, Lucia said. Jokes have no place here. I would like to think that my mother and I were remembered if only for a minute. She turned away from him and stared into the empty street. She said, You would never understand. That was never your métier, Alec, understanding the situation of others. I am sorry now that I asked you to come with me.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec did not reply but thought to himself, You forgot him. Why would he not forget you?</p>
<p class="follow">All this time we thought he was dead. We had no idea where he was. We had no idea how he died and where he was buried.</p>
<p class="follow">And then Andre was back, slamming the door behind him, humming some unfamiliar melody, standing at the porch railing inhaling the night air, searching his pockets for his cigarettes and ivory holder, his matches, absently rubbing the waxy skin where his little finger had been. He reached down suddenly to pat Lucia's knee, three taps and a gentle squeeze, smiling all the while.</p>
<p class="follow">I am so pleased you have come to see me, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">Papa, she said, and for a moment Alec thought she would break down.</p>
<p class="follow">I wasn't certain that you would, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">Of course, Papa. What did you think?</p>
<p class="follow">One never knows, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">I admit it was a shock to me, hearing from you.</p>
<p class="follow">It could not be avoided, he said. Andre said nothing more for a moment, looking fondly at his daughter. He said at last, I see a little of me in you.</p>
<p class="follow">She smiled and said that Kryg had remarked on the resemblance.</p>
<p class="follow">Kryg was not stupid, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">I didn't like him, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">He was harmless. I think Kryg never found his true place in the world. He did not want to make enemies. He spent most of his life staying out of harm's way and then harm came to him in Corsica.</p>
<p class="follow">Sardinia, Lucia said.</p>

<p class="follow">Corsica, Andre said sharply. He gave Lucia's knee a final pat and sat down in the rocking chair. For a moment no one spoke. Kryg had been disposed of.</p>
<p class="follow">So you arrived in Prague, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, Andre agreed.</p>
<p class="follow">What happened then?</p>
<p class="follow">That's enough of my story, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">No, Papa, Lucia said. Please go on.</p>
<p class="follow">Old war stories are boring, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">Not to me, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">I went looking for friends, Andre said with a sigh. I needed papers. I needed some proof of identity, it didn't matter whose identity. Nationality didn't matter. The papers mattered. I had friends who managed that sort of thing. But it took me a while to find them. So many were dead or moved away. I had been out of touch for a long time and only my closest friends knew where I had been. They had been sworn to silence and they were not eager in any case to reopen the book. It had been a long time. I was not certain and they were not certain whether I was wanted in some other jurisdiction. At last I found a friend, the one I needed. He and his wife and your mother and I used to see each other in Prague in the old days. Quite the surprise for him when I showed up at his door. He made the necessary inquiries, which did take quite some time. There were no outstanding warrants. So he fixed me up with an identity card and a passport and I went away to the mountains. End of story.</p>
<p class="follow">But—where in the mountains?</p>
<p class="follow">Andre laughed. A small resort in Yugoslavia. Nobody ever heard of it. One chairlift. I got a job operating the chairlift and giving ski lessons on the side. I had my own chalet, quite comfortable. Living was cheap, a happy interlude for me. My health came back quicker than I expected, no doubt the result of mountain air, downhill skiing, a decent diet, and anonymity. An average life, I would say. And as I told you, I have a strong constitution.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre paused here, his expression resigned. He took the cigarette pack from his pocket, looked at it, and put it back. Also, he said, I was able to ignore politics. Politics was not a part of the mountain air. Politics was elsewhere, vanished along with Hitler and Stalin. Yugoslavia was restless, but Yugoslavia is always restless, so little space, so many tribes. Yugoslavia is an unnatural state but it is beautiful all the same. We had no television and no newspapers. I was done with politics anyway. But you cannot remain incognito forever, Andre said. There are too many people in the world and they are always traveling and eventually an acquaintance arrives at the resort. She doesn't recognize me but I recognize her because I make it my business to look closely at our travelers. She is the wife of an old comrade. She is alone. I'm the sort of fellow, as I'm sure you understand, who is naturally curious. When I have an itch I scratch the itch. So when she arrives at my chairlift I say to her,</p>
<p class="follow">How are you, Sonja?</p>
<p class="follow">She looks at me, bewildered.</p>
<p class="follow">It's Andre, Sonja.</p>
<p class="follow">Of course she thinks she has seen a ghost. I thought she would faint.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre?</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, Andre.</p>
<p class="follow">I heard a rumor—</p>
<p class="follow">That I was alive after all?</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, that was the rumor. I didn't believe it.</p>
<p class="follow">As you can see, Sonja. Here I am.</p>
<p class="follow">Unchanged, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">Yet you did not recognize me.</p>
<p class="follow">Do you always wear your ski mask, Andre? Indoors as well as out?</p>

<p class="follow">So I closed the chairlift and we walked in the cold to the village for lunch, a lunch that lasted most of the afternoon as Sonja brought me up to date. Her husband, Rolf, my old friend, is dead. Two of her three sons have said goodbye to her and immigrated to America. They went to Detroit to work in the auto industry. She does not know the whereabouts of her youngest boy but she fears he is involved in the Prague underworld. He sends her money every month, she says, and as she talks I remember this child—now a middle-aged man—as sweet-tempered and shy, everyone's favorite. Sonja asks me if I know about the Prague underworld and I say I do not. She tells me that Prague now is worse than it was under the Soviets, and then she paused and said that hers was a generational attitude. Young people seem to thrive in Prague, the films, the music and the dancing, the sex. We had sex, too, but not so much music and dancing. We did not have the money for music and dancing and if we did have the money music and dancing were not permitted or at least not permitted to excess. Amusement generally was discouraged, but we found a way, didn't we, Andre? I would say we reached a separate peace, Sonja said. She brought me the news of all our mutual friends, many of them gone, most of the rest living here and there on the margins. She herself lived in a village in Bohemia. There are still a few around who would love to see you, Sonja said. Your name comes up all the time. They say you were the best, Andre.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm retired, I told her.</p>
<p class="follow">What are you retired from, Andre? She said this with a smile.</p>
<p class="follow">Politics, I said.</p>
<p class="follow">Did I mention politics?</p>
<p class="follow">You were about to, I said.</p>
<p class="follow">I heard you were in Russia, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">I was, I told her.</p>
<p class="follow">She nodded, an expression of sympathy, and did not inquire further. The details of the camps were well known and my story did not differ in any important way from the other stories. She said, I would like to tell our friends that you're back among us. That the rumor is true. That you live here. Allow me to do this. It would mean a great deal to them to see you again. You look well, by the way.</p>
<p class="follow">I lead a healthy life, I told her.</p>
<p class="follow">How long have you been here?</p>
<p class="follow">Years, I said.</p>
<p class="follow">Living alone? she said.</p>
<p class="follow">Oh, yes.</p>
<p class="follow">That's not like you, Andre.</p>
<p class="follow">I told you, I said. I'm retired.</p>
<p class="follow">Retired from life? she said.</p>
<p class="follow">Something like that, I said.</p>
<p class="follow">So I may tell the others?</p>
<p class="follow">I would appreciate it if you didn't, I said.</p>
<p class="follow">You're content, then, with your chairlift and your skiing lessons.</p>
<p class="follow">For the moment, I said.</p>
<p class="follow">Very well, she said. I understand.</p>
<p class="follow">Of course she didn't understand. There's a limit to understanding. Extreme situations do not yield to understanding. She sympathized and that was enough. We seemed to have run out of conversation. I am sure that if a stranger had stepped into the restaurant he would have taken us for an old married couple, together so long we did not have to speak to make ourselves understood. Coffee grew cold in our cups but still we did not move. Sonja was staring out one window, I out another. The waiter dozed at a table in the corner. Something remained to be said but I did not know what it was. Finally Sonja looked up.</p>
<p class="follow">Do you remember Dusko? Of course you remember Dusko, she said, everyone knows Dusko the busybody. She went on and on about Dusko, leading up to something, I couldn't imagine what. Then she said that Dusko was back on the battlefield, our battlefield, the one her husband Rolf and I occupied during World War Two. He had been at it a year or more investigating the killings. The word Sonja used was "atrocities." Dusko was methodically driving from village to village collecting evidence, searching for documents, interviewing everyone in sight. A number of villagers remembered the German occupation very well and that was the focus of Dusko's inquiry. They were eager to tell of their privations, the cruelty of the Germans and the atmosphere of violence everywhere in the district. And in the course of his interviews, Sonja said, he turned up evidence of atrocities committed by our commando, Rolf's and mine. You know Dusko, she said, he's tireless. He'll go to the ends of the earth if he has to.</p>
<p class="follow">Who's paying him? I said.</p>
<p class="follow">A writer, Sonja said.</p>
<p class="follow">What kind of writer? I asked.</p>
<p class="follow">An American historian, Sonja said. The historian is writing a book on forgotten atrocities of World War Two in Europe. He's compiled quite a list, mostly Nazi atrocities. But Nazi atrocities are a dime a dozen, they're not news. But he thinks he's on to something fresh with your commando, your international brigade doing the Lord's work in Yugoslavia. So he and Dusko are retracing your line of march, your orders, where you went, what you did, and who you did it to. A neglected episode, the historian calls it. That's according to Dusko.</p>
<p class="follow">I looked at my watch. Time to go.</p>
<p class="follow">It would be good if you would have a word with Dusko, Andre. Your word would carry weight with him. It's monstrous, what he's doing.</p>
<p class="follow">I have no interest in Dusko, I said.</p>
<p class="follow">That's not the point, Andre. Dusko has an interest in you.</p>
<p class="follow">And poor Rolf, she added.</p>
<p class="follow">I can't bear it.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">Andre smiled into the darkness, poured schnapps once more, and lit a cigarette. Alec leaned forward in his chair, rapt, waiting for the rest of the story. But Andre had said all he was prepared to say. The story hung there like the smoke from his cigarette, slowly dispersing in the balmy air. Lucia nervously turned her wedding ring and stared at her father.</p>
<p class="follow">What did you do, Papa?</p>
<p class="follow">Hush, Andre said. Enjoy the evening.</p>
<p class="follow">I can't enjoy the evening, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm tired, Andre said. I've talked too much.</p>
<p class="follow">I don't know what to think, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre shrugged and began to rock in his chair. He blew one smoke ring after another and took a swallow of schnapps, shuddering. All the houses round and about had lights burning, television's electric glow visible in every living room. A settled community, Alec thought. What must they think of the inhabitants of Goya House? From far away came the bleat of an ambulance siren.</p>
<p class="follow">Did you find Dusko? Alec asked.</p>
<p class="follow">It wasn't hard, Andre said. It was like following the tracks of an elephant. Dusko and his historian were not careful. Nor discreet. They made enemies wherever they went because they excited suspicion. No one knew what they were after really. The American had an unfortunate manner. I had never met anyone like him before until I came here and began to watch American television, news programs and quiz shows. He seemed to think he was bringing enlightenment to these peasant communities and they were somehow obligated to tell him whatever they knew. And a few did. There were many scars from the war and the scars have not healed. They will never heal. I believe Dusko and the historian were in some danger owing to the indiscreet way they went about things, their brusque questions and insistence on answers. Dusko should have known better. But he was being very well paid and I think in some sense he was seeking absolution for his own actions in the war. Or, I should say, his inaction. So they were in a spot of trouble when I arrived. I don't think they knew how much trouble. When Dusko saw me he nearly collapsed. He pretended not to know me. He pretended not to know my name.</p>
<p class="follow">Dusko has had a loss of memory, I told the historian.</p>
<p class="follow">No wonder, so many years ago. But I'm sure, on reflection, he'll recall our long and complicated friendship.</p>
<p class="follow">I bring regards from Sonja.</p>
<p class="follow">Sonja told me of your project and now I'm here to help.</p>
<p class="follow">After you, I said, ushering Dusko and the historian into their car, a green Land Rover piled high with expensive luggage, food in tins, and a case of whiskey. The American historian was quite young, I would judge not yet fifty years old, too young to have known the war. I directed them to one village after another, describing the actions of my commando. I spared nothing. I told them everything in my memory. Along the way I helped them interview the old people who had been present. Once or twice my name came up, not always in a flattering way. I did nothing to prevent them telling their stories nor did I disclose my identity to them. Once or twice I was able to help them along, innocently asking questions about this bridge or that rail line. The farmhouse where the Nazi headquarters was. Many times the old people answered falsely or incompletely, at least according to my memory of events. We drove from one district to another with the aid of a map someone had given the historian. I was with them for almost half a year and at the end of that time they had a fairly complete picture of our orders, where we went, what we did, and who we did it to. Also, they had a fairly complete picture of the Nazis, what they did, and who they did it to. I wanted them to know the war in the round, the atmosphere at the time, the hatred we felt one to the others. How the cost in lives diminished year to year until at the end of the war the cost was negligible. Hardly any cost at all. There were so many dead that the battlefield seemed to us like a bonfire, and the dead so many stray twigs fed into it. They had no more significance than that. We killed anything that moved. So did they. We both did terrible things. They killed many more because they had many more men and heavy weapons. But that was the only reason. I walked Dusko and his historian through each action, where we were, where they were, how the matter progressed, and the results. I described our tactics, their tactics, and the advantages and disadvantages of each. I described also the civilians who were caught up in it. They had nowhere to go. For them we were like a great natural disaster, a hurricane or a flood, except there was no high ground. And at last the fascists caught us. They killed most everyone in the commando. We had nowhere to run. But five of us survived and the other four died in the prison camp in Poland. We five were greatly surprised that they did not shoot us where we lay but I think they wanted us to experience a German prison camp. The camp would be the great punishment. I wanted Dusko and his American historian to understand the world we lived in, its limits and its excesses, how things went day to day, and the kind of man you became. But in the end they did not understand any more than Sonja understood. Any more than you understand. So I was left with sympathy. I wanted them to know that no one could judge us. No one had the right. No one who was not there with us day to day. Perhaps God will judge us. But we doubted that God would take the trouble.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre fell silent again and gave an enormous yawn.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia said, Was the book ever published?</p>
<p class="follow">No. It was never written.</p>
<p class="follow">The historian took your advice, then.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre shook his head. No. He died. When Andre saw the look on Lucia's face he smiled fractionally and added, Natural causes. He worked and worked on the book, worked on it for years. But in the end he could not write it. In any case, he didn't. From time to time he would pass me a letter via Dusko, questions about this or that event. Trivial questions, I thought. Dates, times of day, the nutritional value of the rations we ate, the color of a man's eyes. Then the letters stopped. Dusko sent word that the historian was dead. A little after that Dusko died and the matter was closed.</p>
<p class="follow">All this time Andre had been talking directly to his daughter, watching her reactions to his account.</p>
<p class="follow">The silence lengthened. Alec said, What was the historian's name?</p>
<p class="follow">Andre said, Holder.</p>
<p class="follow">Jimmy Holder, Alec said. I knew him. He was one of the foreign correspondents on the paper I worked for. He went to Vietnam, one tour after another. He couldn't get enough of it. He was one of those who was unable to forget the war. He quit the paper to write books, military histories. Successful books.</p>
<p class="follow">That was his name, Andre said. He continued to look at Lucia, whose eyes were downcast. He was uninterested in the biography of Jimmy Holder. As he said, the matter was closed. Yet one fact of Andre's tale was in error. The historian did not die of natural causes. He took his own life after his wife died. He himself was in poor health and could not manage without her. That was the explanation that went around.</p>
<p class="follow">I knew him quite well, Alec said. Lucia did, too.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre shook his head, tapping his earpiece; evidently he did not hear Alec clearly. He turned to Lucia and asked some question about Nikolas. Alec slipped off into reverie, remembering Jimmy Holder. Everyone liked him, a hard-drinking raconteur who did not approve of Alec's refusal to photograph the war. Such a refusal gave all journalists a bad name and served only to fortify the right wing, and he implied that Alec's reputation would suffer also. Everyone had to pay his dues. When Alec quit the paper Jimmy Holder said he had made the right decision. Despite the disagreement they remained friends, though they saw less and less of each other as time went on. Alec was bemused at the coincidence and had difficulty imagining Jimmy, overweight and hung-over, charging around Yugoslavia with Andre. Coincidence seemed epidemic in the news business, friendships replicating the news itself, so often repetitive, reductive, and inclined to formula.</p>
<p class="follow">Thinking of Jimmy Holder, Alec thought now of his father and resolved to visit the grave in the morning, say a few last words. The service had been perfunctory, though the reverend—and he had forgotten the reverend's name. Wallace? The Reverend Wallace had done a fine job, a touch on the pompous side but his father never minded pomposity so long as it was kept within bounds. Kim Malone once said that in the United States Senate pomposity was a sacrament. You didn't necessarily treasure it but you missed its absence. Pomposity resembled the intentional walk in baseball, tedious and action-slowing but vital to the integrity of the game. Integrity was necessary in the news business also. Alec supposed that if he had gone to Vietnam his life would have taken a different turn, driven by the one experience so drenched in the atmosphere of violence. Jimmy Holder had taken his own life by gunshot. Yet war service had not diminished Andre. Alec remembered Andre deep in thought when he and Lucia had come upon him on the porch of Goya House. Was he remembering the war? His daughter? A café in Prague? Andre Duran had as much vitality as any man Alec had ever met. He thought again of twigs into the bonfire. We did terrible things. We killed anything that moved. No one could judge us. No one who had not been with us day to day. God himself would not take the trouble. Alec thought his father would probably agree. He believed the legislative craft was beyond the ken of outsiders. The apparatus of it was mystifying. The rules often contradicted themselves. No one outside the field of combat could appreciate the personal and political loyalties of members of Congress. Even the bribe was ambiguous. One man's bribe was another's campaign contribution. Of course every election cycle the voters had their say and that verdict was final, ill informed as it was bound to be, yet another burden of democracy. Alec looked up to find Lucia and Andre staring at him, Lucia saying something.</p>
<p class="follow">We should go now, Alec.</p>
<p class="follow">And then they heard a wild commotion at the curb, cars thundering up the street and parking in front of Goya House, men spilling from the doors, shouts and bursts of conversation. Lucia recoiled from the sudden noise; the neighborhood had been so quiet. Andre was on his feet at once, waving his arms and giving a kind of lupine growl. Alec rose also, alarmed, watching the men gather on the sidewalk, shouting at Andre. A few of them gripped beer cans. All of them were wearing Basque berets and leather jackets of various colors. They rushed across the lawn to lean against the porch railing, everyone talking at once, their arms around one another's shoulders, Andre grinning, his hands flung wide in welcome.</p>
<p class="follow">They loved the soccer game, Andre said to Lucia.</p>
<p class="follow">These are my housemates, he added.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre signaled for quiet and introduced Lucia and Alec, the conversation subsiding at once. There were eight men, all of them older but not so old as Andre, and they all extended their hands in greeting. Alec could not identify the language they spoke. There were several languages in any case. They were all tipsy and a few of them were frankly drunk and having difficulty with their footing. But they were in very good humor and now began to explain something to Andre, evidently an account of the soccer match. Their team, whatever team it was, had won. That was obvious. The conversation went on and on, a din. Across the street someone opened her front door, looked out, and retreated back inside. More beer was produced and Andre poured schnapps once again, happily listening to their accounts of the game, winding down now. And after a while the men made their goodbyes and drifted away, stomping up the porch stairs and through the front door, dispersing to their various rooms. The downstairs toilet flushed and flushed again. In a few minutes the house was quiet and the street silent as before. Andre, Lucia, and Alec took their seats once more on the porch in the darkness. A sudden chill was in the air.</p>
<p class="follow">Soccer, Andre said. The one thing that reminds them of home. They are boys again when they go to the game. They become very excited. The neighbors are used to it. I hope you weren't bothered.</p>
<p class="follow">Not at all, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">They are good boys, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">Mostly Czech? Alec asked.</p>
<p class="follow">They are from all over middle Europe, and not only Europe. They were very surprised. They did not know I had a daughter.</p>
<p class="follow">We must leave now, Papa.</p>
<p class="follow">Will you come to see me again?</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, of course.</p>
<p class="follow">Tomorrow?</p>
<p class="follow">In the morning, Lucia said. I leave for Zurich in the early evening.</p>
<p class="follow">So soon?</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, I'm afraid so. But I'll be back.</p>
<p class="follow">The morning will be fine, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">I'll bring Mathilde, Lucia said. And sometime you must meet Nikolas. You and Nikolas will have much to talk about.</p>
<p class="follow">I am eager to see Mathilde, Andre said. My only grandchild. And then he smiled broadly and added, That I know of.</p>
<p class="follow">She wants very badly to meet you, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">I'll be here on my porch, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">I am glad I came, Papa.</p>
<p class="follow">I, too, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">Goodbye, Andre, Alec said.</p>

<p class="follow">Goodbye, goodbye, Andre said.</p>
<p class="follow">Tomorrow, Papa, Lucia said, and kissed him on his cheek.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">Lucia drove slowly back to Military Road, turning at Wisconsin Avenue. Traffic was light, the rush hour concluded. They were silent in the car until Alec asked Lucia the name of the minister who officiated at his father's graveside. Willis, she said. Oh, yes, Alec said. The Reverend Willis. I do that all the time now, forget names. He was looking out the window at the familiar street, the department stores and hardware stores, movie houses and liquor stores and restaurants. He searched and searched for the Chinese restaurant he knew so well but it was not where it should have been, and then he remembered that it was on Connecticut Avenue, not Wisconsin. It was years since he had been there, the last time with Mathilde when she was a teenager. My God, he thought, that would have been the Carter administration, conceivably Reagan One, somewhere in there. Alec remembered that he and Mathilde had Peking duck, amusing themselves with the fortune cookies that came with dessert. They went to the movies later, one of the James Bond epics. The star was one of Connery's successors, the one with the smirk, Roger Moore. Mathilde was taken with him. Maybe his memory wasn't going to hell after all.</p>
<p class="follow">Tell me something, Alec said. Was he what you expected?</p>
<p class="follow">The Reverend Willis? Lucia said, puzzled.</p>
<p class="follow">Your father, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">I didn't know what to expect, Lucia said. I had no image of him in my mind. I mean, nothing specific beyond a handsome man in a Borsalino hat. But that image went away when I saw him.</p>
<p class="follow">You spoke of him very seldom, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">I know. He was not part of my life. I remembered nothing of him. Only what my mother told me, and I am pretty certain that she made revisions. Perhaps made things up. I never knew why they split up. I mean, something I could believe. Something that made sense. That's why, when Mathilde was old enough, I told her everything about us. The life we had together and the advent of Nikolas. I didn't want her to be in the dark, as I was. I didn't want her living with a mystery.</p>
<p class="follow">Nothing wrong with mysteries, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">I don't like them, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Sometimes you have to learn to live with them.</p>
<p class="follow">Not me. Not if I can avoid it.</p>
<p class="follow">They drove on in silence, one stoplight after another. Finally Lucia said, Do we look alike?</p>
<p class="follow">Absolutely, Alec said. You must have seen it. His eyes. The set of his chin. His laugh. His gestures.</p>
<p class="follow">I suppose I did, Lucia said. Didn't want to admit it.</p>
<p class="follow">He is very masculine and you are very feminine. Still, two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p class="follow">I admit it was strange, seeing him.</p>
<p class="follow">He knew it, too, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Thank you for coming with me, Lucia said. I was—nervous.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm glad I came, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">You are?</p>
<p class="follow">An interesting man, your father.</p>
<p class="follow">I suppose so, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">A twentieth-century life, Alec said. Every inch.</p>
<p class="follow">I cannot admire his life, Lucia said. A life of violence, a life that seems to me to have been dictated by history. I wish he had turned his back. I wish he had found a way to stay with my mother. She had an empty place in her heart because of him. I do, too. He does not recognize that. He does not appreciate the wreckage he left behind. That was his achievement. I cannot admire it.</p>
<p class="follow">You, too, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="follow">You, too, have led a twentieth-century life. Every inch.</p>
<p class="follow">They were in Georgetown now, on his street, then at Mrs. Wheatley's old house, a stretch limousine, bone white in color, at the curb, delivering two couples in evening dress. Lucia waited behind the limo until the passengers were on the sidewalk and the chauffeur eased away. A butler opened the door and stood aside as the guests swept through. Beyond the open door Alec saw the others, women clutching little black purses, men with their hands in their pockets. White-coated waiters passed drinks and canapés. Alec recognized one of the women as a television commentator of liberal slant, in earnest discussion with an army general in fullest fig, about one square foot of decorations on the left side of his dress jacket, stars on his shoulders. From the look of things the television commentator was doing most of the talking, not that the general appeared to care; she was an attractive woman, almost as tall as the general. And then the front door slammed shut. Lucia continued on down the block, and when she pulled up in front of Alec's house the interior was dark. Mathilde had yet to return.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec said, Do you remember Jimmy Holder? Your father's historian.</p>
<p class="follow">Vaguely, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">He quit the newspaper because they brought him home and made him an editor. He hated editing. He missed the battlefield and all those countries he visited. Mostly he missed his byline. So he took a buyout and wrote books instead.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia rolled her eyes. She was drumming her fingers on the steering wheel, impatient to be off. Those reporter friends of yours, she said. They all blend into one. It was so long ago.</p>
<p class="follow">Give my best to your father when you see him tomorrow.</p>
<p class="follow">I will, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">And if you get the chance, ask him how he got to Goya House.</p>
<p class="follow">If I get the chance, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">It's a strange setup, Alec said. A bit of a mystery.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia said, In case you're interested, I don't look on my life as a twentieth-century life. I look on it as a normal life. She spat the words as if she could not get rid of them fast enough. And I don't think you admire my father. I think you're envious of him. Envious of the wreckage.</p>
<p class="follow">No one envies wreckage, Lucia. I do admire fidelity. Alec stepped from the car and she drove away without another word. He fumbled with his keys a moment; when Mathilde had gone out she had forgotten to turn on the lights. He stepped inside the house, collected the mail from the floor, and leafed through it as he pressed the button on the answering machine. One message, Mathilde announcing she was spending the night with a friend and would call in the morning. Alec dropped the mail on the hall table and ambled into the kitchen, intending to pour a glass of wine until he thought better of it and poured Scotch instead. He stood on the steps leading to the garden, sipping whiskey and sifting through Andre Duran's crowded biography. But he quickly tired of that and wandered back inside. Nothing of interest in the refrigerator except a carton of eggs, enough for an omelet. He wasn't hungry. Alec looked into the living room and sat in the big wing chair, facing the west wall where his photographs were clustered, more than fifty years of work, his pleasure and his livelihood, what he liked to think was the organizing principle of his life. The ones on the wall were not necessarily the best photographs but his favorites, having to do with the circumstances of the shoot or the personality of the subject, and as he looked at them he thought he would go to his father's grave in the morning, shoot something in black and white. He stared now at the Jefferson Memorial at dawn and the facade of Mrs. Wheatley's house, the grille of a Buick poking through the right edge. All the photographs were set in simple black frames. Next to Mrs. Wheatley's house was a shot of Jimmy Stewart, nonchalant in a dinner jacket, a flute of champagne in his hand, homespun Mr. Smith as worldly as any Georgetown gigolo. Mathilde at a tender age concentrating on a chessboard, her index finger touching the queen's crown. Annalise on the beach at Malibu, delicious in a yellow bikini, balancing a red beach ball on her nose like a trained seal. His father asleep at his desk on the Senate floor. The Japanese houseman Charles, a faint smile at play on his mouth, holding someone's overcoat. There were a dozen others—his garden in the moonlight, his mother smoking a cigarette on the terrace of the Chevy Chase house, Duke Ellington shaking hands with the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Henry Fonda brandishing a nine-iron, Oleg Cassini, the Countess d'An, Joseph Alsop, Admiral Honeycutt, the Confederate infantryman, Jacqueline Onassis, and the newsroom of the paper late at night, no one in sight, identical desks with identical typewriters, the big Westclox on the wall reading midnight. Finally, the long-ago Georgetown students, on book, giving <em>Lear</em> everything they had.</p>
<p class="follow">The telephone rang but Alec did not rise to answer it. He sipped his drink and looked carefully at the photographs, one after another, up and down and left and right. He realized that none of them were of recent vintage. He remembered the circumstances of each shoot, the location and the time of day, the solid feel of the miraculous Leica in his hand. Cassini and Admiral Honeycutt were caught unawares, Cassini in a bathing suit on the terrace of a villa in the south of France, the admiral taking his afternoon constitutional. Jimmy Stewart and Mathilde were more or less posed. Annalise was pretending not to pose. The unseen figure was himself, the man behind the camera, the mechanic at the engine; and then he saw a sliver of shadow on Annalise's red beach ball, his own. Naturally all the photographs had his signature, though Alec was hard put to say precisely what that signature was, its specific stamp, its tone of voice. Alec wondered what it was that bound the photographs together or if anything bound them together. They were his favorite shots so somewhere ran a common theme, the extended imagery of a poem or a song's ostinato. Alec rose and stepped forward until he was a foot from the wall, looking at the photographs again each in turn. He closed his bad right eye so that he could see more clearly, judging the light, the boundary of the shot, the feel of the material. He finished his whiskey and put the glass on the sideboard. Now he closed his good eye, moving from one photograph to the next so that all the photographs were in motion, variations on Munch's <em>Scream.</em> But that was not the common theme, far from it. Alec stood staring at the wall of images for many minutes and realized finally with the most open dismay that the common theme was the absence of conflict.</p>
