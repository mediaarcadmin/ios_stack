<h1 class="chaptertitle">LUCIA</h1>
<p class="left"><b>A</b><span style="font-size: smaller">LEC WAS SILENT</span> a minute or more, allowing his memory to drift backward to a vanished civilization as mysterious as Phoenicia. His memories of it were scattered and not entirely reliable. What did he remember most fondly? Alec supposed it was his rose garden. In that soft southern climate anything that germinated would grow but roses grew wonderfully. They had no natural enemies except blight, old age, and insects. When Lucia first arrived in the capital from Zurich she noticed gardens full of roses and longed for a garden of her own. She believed, incorrectly, that Washington was a city of gardeners. She did come to understand eventually that Washington was a city of lookers at gardens, quite another thing surely.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia found the people hospitable but their argot irritated her. Washingtonians liked to refer to <em>this town,</em> often with a roll of the eyeballs, as in, We do things a certain way in <em>this town. This town,</em> the odds are always six to five against. Lucia thought the city blanched, an overcooked vegetable. In high summer Washington was a metropolis of civic torpor, heavy velvety heat that clung to your skin like a cape. The tour buses moved in slow motion and when they halted at the Treasury or the Lincoln Memorial their passengers seemed to ooze from the interior, a slow-flowing damp-shirted civilian tide unaware that they were visiting a ghost town. Statecraft came to a standstill in the killing summer heat. The government evacuated to the Virginia horse country or the Eastern Shore or New England in the way that Madrid emptied into San Sebastian or the hill towns of Andalusia and Paris to Brittany or the Cote d'Azur. August was a lost month. Even the newspapers operated with skeleton staffs. Still, those workers who remained were careful to wear suits and ties and the women dresses. The government had its formal aspect.</p>
<p class="follow">After a furious courtship Alec and Lucia found a small row house on a quiet street in Georgetown, the historic district, well away from the commotion of the Federal Triangle. A family-owned dry cleaner occupied one corner, a one-room market the corner opposite. At any time of day a housekeeper could be seen carrying an armload of clothes to or from the dry cleaner. At two in the afternoon the brick sidewalks echoed from the high heels of well-dressed women returning from lunch or an appointment at the hairdresser, and a few hours later the faintly hilarious voices of the Bridge Bunch, a dozen women who had been gathering at Mrs. Wheatley's house since the early days of the Truman administration, second and third Tuesdays of every month except August, when Mrs. Wheatley and her staff motored to an oceanside cottage at Newport. Alec's mother was one of the regulars. There were not so many men on the street during the day, save for the esthete Ronald diAntonio who liked to walk his Afghan hound at four, and Admiral Honeycutt who took a brisk constitutional at five. They rarely met, and when they did the greeting was cool.</p>
<p class="follow">"Admiral."</p>
<p class="follow">"Ronald."</p>
<p class="follow">Alec thought the neighborhood had a European feel to it, though precisely what that feel was he could not say, since he had been to Europe just once, as a child, accompanying his parents on a senatorial junket that featured American hotels and French museums; an embassy reception ended the day. Perhaps it was the lack of haste in the streets, and the regularity of the neighbors' habits, and the uniformity of the houses, many of them dating from the Federal period. The small shops, the dry cleaner, and a tiny grocery store down the street lent the neighborhood a mom-and-pop commercial aspect. Also, Alec found an appealing modesty to the cars that lined the streets—Volkswagens and Ford Falcons, the admiral's black Chevrolet, Ronald diAntonio's Dodge. Mrs. Wheatley had a Vuillard on the wall of her dining room but the car on the street outside was a 1955 Buick. European egalitarianism, Alec concluded, a disinclination to display wealth, at least out of doors. Lucia, who had grown up in Europe, agreed that the street was not the normal American street—whatever that was—but it did not remind her of Europe, either. It was true that many of their neighbors were elderly, Mrs. Wheatley near sixty and the admiral at least eighty years old, but there were couples their own age, too, with children. Tricycles and red wagons crowded the front stoops of three houses across the street, and that was not at all normal in a settled district in a European capital; young people could not afford the rent. More to the point, Lucia had the feeling that in Washington life was lived not in houses but in offices downtown, whereas in Europe it was the reverse. Alec was habitually late for dinner, and at parties the men seemed able to talk convincingly only of work, the projects they were involved in and office intrigue, meaning political intrigue. With the advent of the Kennedys, government had acquired a glamour entirely absent in Europe. Glamour would not be the word attached to Chancellor Erhard or Prime Minister Macmillan, though the Profumo mess suggested the presence of a demimonde, willing girls and their middle-aged suitors meeting at country houses for a weekend frolic while the wives looked on, and all of it spread across the front pages of national newspapers. There seemed to be no such demimonde in Washington, so buttoned up and serious-minded. Lucia's view was changed only marginally when one afternoon she encountered her father-in-law's great friend Eliot Bergruen emerging from Mrs. Wheatley's doorway. He was charming as always but a little distant and he did not linger. Eliot Bergruen had failed to ask after Alec.</p>
<p class="follow">Eliot? Alec said that evening. Impossible. You must have been mistaken.</p>
<p class="follow">No, it was Eliot. We spoke for a moment.</p>
<p class="follow">Huh. Well, Eliot handles wills and trusts among his other specialties, so probably that was it. A house call.</p>
<p class="follow">He looked so debonair with his boutonniere and his cane, Lucia replied.</p>
<p class="follow">Thick-waisted trees lined the street, at midmorning giving it the ambiance of a settled neighborhood in a small historic town. No one was about. In summer the trees provided welcome shade even in the back yard, the one that measured twelve by twenty feet, space enough for a round table and four chairs, bounded by a high wooden stake fence. The roses climbed the fence, white and yellow and five shades of red, large and small roses with gnarled stems that reminded Alec of the faces of old-timers in the city room of the newspaper, men (and a few women) with taut self-conscious faces, seen-everything faces, habit-of-service faces, world-weary and droll. They had unexpected answers to routine questions, as Alec explained to Lucia one night after she had asked about his colleagues at work, what sort of people they were. Alec rarely brought home anyone from the newspaper office. They were old, he said, with college-age children and, in a few cases, grandchildren. They have no interest in people like us.</p>
<p class="follow">But they did know things about the texture of life in the capital. Alec had overheard one of the young reporters complain about Washington's cab drivers, slow to the point of inertia, cabs habitually lagging behind general traffic. Negroes especially did not understand the concept of promptness, moving customers with dispatch from point A to point B. Time had no meaning for them because they were fundamentally lazy. Horseshit, one of the seen-everything faces said. They're slow because they're cautious, and they're cautious because they're scared. Cop pulls them over if they're doing one mile over the speed limit. That's a fifty-dollar fine and maybe a trip to the station house, where the paperwork is lost and they spend a night in the can, probably slapped around a little. Maybe you've noticed and if you haven't you should. In this town all the cops are white and the cabbies are black. And that's why they take their time motoring up Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>
<p class="follow">That's a terrible story, Lucia said. Can't something be done?</p>
<p class="follow">Not so far, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Your father—</p>
<p class="follow">Alec laughed. No, no. He's involved in the Defense Department supplemental.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">The garden had been allowed to decay, a matter of simple indifference on the part of the previous owners, but Alec and Lucia soon put it right. In the spring and summer the roses seemed to grow as they watched. In early evening, the garden in deep shadow, the rose petals seemed to Alec to assume fantastic shapes, harelips, cleft palates, divided faces, faces divided against themselves. Alec made shot after shot of the divided faces but was never able to capture on film what he saw with his own eyes. He liked to shoot at twilight, the buzz of the neighborhood all around him, the whir of air conditioners and the slippery sound of automobiles on the soft tarmac of the street, show tunes from Admiral Honeycutt's vintage phonograph. Then, round about six-thirty, they heard one voice and then another, a gathering chorus reminiscent of the chattering of songbirds at sunrise. Cocktail time had begun, latish because the upper bureaucracy worked late. Often the men didn't arrive home until well after seven, usually carrying a heavy briefcase. A briefcase and a frown, according to Lucia.</p>
<p class="follow">The brick house next to theirs, very grand, had a wide and deep back yard with a towering cedar at its center and benches and wrought-iron tables placed at intervals as in a park. A fountain splashed all day and all night, always the sound of falling water. Lucia called the neighbors' house the Alhambra. Each evening Charles, the Japanese butler, brought a tray to the garden. Alec and Lucia could hear the creak of his starched shirt and the clink of glasses and his murmured announcement that drinks were served, your excellency and madame—and in a moment the count and countess arrived and helped themselves to champagne, thank you Charles, no need to detain yourself. On his way out Charles lit the torchères that bathed the garden in yellow light. And not long after that, guests arrived speaking a variety of languages, settling into the events of the day, always so puzzling to foreigners, the interplay of the legislature, the courts, and the White House—called, not entirely with sarcasm, the Palace—all of it overseen by an amiable yet reckless press forever seeking accommodation when accommodation was the least desirable of the many, many opportunities open to democracies. The truth was, since the triumph of the Cuban missile crisis—a miracle of statecraft—America had lost its nerve. America had turned its back on victory. The Palace had settled for stalemate, and that was the true meaning of fear breeding fear, Munich turned on its head. Kennedy and his people had refused to go the last inch.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec was often late, so Lucia sat alone in their garden, shamelessly eavesdropping, listening to heavy accents that ranged from indignation to resignation and back again, hearing the voices of her youth, voices crowded into her mother's second-floor study in Zurich, words tumbling over themselves while her mother struggled to keep order. Lucia's mother, gone now five years, had been a professor of European history, an exile from Prague who settled comfortably—well, comfortably up to a point; Zurich was not Prague by any stretch of the imagination—in neutral Switzerland. Her mother's great fear was that the small languages of central Europe would disappear, Czech, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, and all the dialects with them. These languages did not export; they were specific to the soil from which they sprang. Czech identity could be expressed only in that language, and the same was true for the others. In her mother's multilingual study all these languages were spoken except when making points of particular subtlety to the company at large—and a point was hardly worth making if it was not subtle—when second languages proved unequal to the task: the Hungarian listening to the Pole, or the Romanian listening to the Czech and striving to grasp precisely what was being said, at which time the company switched to the blunt instruments of German or French, admittedly with the utmost reluctance. Really, it was a kind of crime. The reluctance was most palpable when a German or a Frenchman was present. Fortunately, that was not often.</p>
<p class="follow">Well, her mother said with a decisive shrug, they took everything else so why not our language? Another of war's spoils.</p>
<p class="follow">They—an international they, Asians, Africans, Americans included—did not understand that Europe was not Europe without its central constituencies. Small nations, yes, but vigorous and fundamental to European culture. Was Asia Asian without Cambodia and Burma? Was America American without the upper Midwest and the cotton South? Lucia grew up with the idea of loss, things that were gone and irreplaceable. So she listened avidly to the voices of her youth magically transported to the garden next door, the voices of involuntary exile, echoes of the Caucasus, the Carpathians, the Masurian lakes, Galicia, the Andalusian plain. Most were in flight from the Soviets but there were also republican Spaniards who refused to return home so long as Franco was alive, and a few German Jews disillusioned with Zionism. Lucia listened and thought they were all displaced persons, voices in an existential state of emergency. There was a frontier and they were on the cusp, neither here nor there. The day-to-day life of the American government was of scant interest, merely an inescapable fact of life in Washington. Their obsession was with their own lands, occupied by criminals and usurpers whose specialty was subjugation and humiliation, the long totalitarian night. And as for the German Jews, they did not care for the desert sands or the desert sun or the desert food. They wanted only to return to their language, their music, and their communal life in Leipzig, Dresden, or Weimar, but their memories would not allow them to, and the East German authorities were unenthusiastic in any case. Lucia sat alone and listened to these voices as she would listen to music, Haydn perhaps, or Gustav Mahler. Fate had been unkind and no one had come to their rescue; and perhaps they, too, had been weak. And now they found themselves in America. One night Lucia heard two women discussing Washington. Apparently they were visiting and surprised at what they had found.</p>
<p class="follow">The city is very pleasant, one of them said. I expected vulgarity.</p>
<p class="follow">Certainly there is vulgarity, the other said.</p>
<p class="follow">Not the vulgarity I expected. They do not hate us. Instead, we are accepted.</p>
<p class="follow">Leisl, Washington is not Munich.</p>
<p class="follow">It is not Zurich, either. Or Paris. Or Warsaw.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia's head snapped up at the mention of Zurich and for one moment she was tempted to say something in defense of her city. But what would she say? That in order to remain neutral, compromises were inevitable? Neutrality was a fundamentally unnatural performance, a cat doing a handstand. And now and again the cat was bound to lose concentration, look away, become distracted from the task at hand. The audience expected it.</p>
<p class="follow">They are too busy for vulgarity in its obvious forms.</p>
<p class="follow">I would be more generous than that, Leisl said.</p>

<p class="follow">You would, the other said. But wait. It's there below the surface.</p>
<p class="follow">I have not seen it, Leisl said.</p>
<p class="follow">It's there. It's always there.</p>
<p class="follow">But—Jews are everywhere in the government.</p>
<p class="follow">Tokens only, the other said. A cabinet secretary, one or two on the White House staff. Never, ever, let down your guard, Leisl. You should know better.</p>
<p class="follow">I think I might stay here, Leisl said. I like it. I think the president and his wife are <em>gemütlich.</em> I do wish the symphony orchestra was better. I wish the galleries were better. I miss our coffeehouses and the conversations with artists and writers. And I do so miss our language. But I feel safe.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec listened soberly when Lucia replayed the overheard conversation to him later. He said, Leisl was correct. We don't have that here. Washington has many faults, but anti-Semitism isn't one of them. They don't have time for it. The government absorbs all their energies and all their ambitions. Their loyalty is to their party and the government. People here speak warmly about the state they're from, follow the politics and the football teams and so forth. But religion or ethnic mumbo-jumbo doesn't play a serious part. They like the motto E Pluribus Unum.</p>
<p class="follow">But, she said, what about the cab drivers you were telling me about?</p>
<p class="follow">Alec laughed and said, Touché.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">Lucia had the idea that the exiles would never become reconciled to America, nor would their children. America was their grandchildren's country, blue suede shoes and the senior prom, a job that promised advancement and no politics except briefly every four years, and if you didn't want to pay attention you didn't have to. That was the beauty of America; civics was an option. The Declaration of Independence promised a successful pursuit of happiness, not a pursuit of justice. Lucia's mother favored an engaged life of which the ballot box was but one feature.</p>
<p class="follow">She said, America is a barbarian country, whereas Prague is fraternal.</p>
<p class="follow">America is a fine place if you love capitalism.</p>
<p class="follow">But, she concluded, Prague would not be Prague again in her lifetime. And for that we have the Nazis and Soviets to blame. No one came to our aid.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia herself had no memory of Prague, not the look of the streets or the sky, the castle, the bridge, the river, or the summer weather. She did not remember the house she was born in. She had no memory of the Nazis, and by the time the Soviets invaded she was living in Zurich. She hated the idea of Prague vanishing. She was appalled when she considered what the Eastern Europeans had endured at the hands of the Nazis and the Soviets, twenty-five years of misrule and the end not in sight. Lucia had a toehold in those times without having memory of them. She felt the shadow on her spirit. She was a part of that time whether she wanted to be or not. That was yet another legacy from her mother, an inheritance like blue eyes or left-handedness. And her own knowledge of the Czech language began to fade, had started to slip away when she left Prague, and but a trace remained by the time her mother lay dying in a Zurich clinic. Their last conversations were conducted in German. Lucia did not seem to belong in Prague or Zurich. She did not know where she belonged, only that the voices in the garden next door reminded her of home. She wished she had been kinder to her mother.</p>
<p class="follow">How strange, Lucia thought, sitting in her Washington garden and listening to anonymous voices that brought her so close to herself. She wanted to meet Leisl and Leisl's friend but she could not see through the stake fence, so the guests at the Alhambra parties remained a mystery, identified only by language. She imagined stout gray-haired women and small nervous men, wirerimmed spectacles, scuffed shoes, clouds of cigarette smoke, and in the background the splash of a fountain. Lucia continued to sit quietly, listening to the party break up. She was still trying to fill Prague's blank page in her memory. She was just three years old when she left, by train according to her mother, on passports provided by a considerate friend at the Swiss embassy. They both wept when the train crossed the Austrian frontier at Salzburg, where a correspondence would take them to Zurich. Her mother remembered that Lucia cried and cried, inconsolable; her father had stayed behind but that was not the cause of her tears. Leaving Prague was the cause of her tears. Of that border crossing she had no memory either. Lucia was Czech by birth but did not feel Czech. Her mother and father were Czech but they were lost to her now.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia adored Swiss life, flamboyantly healthy, hiking in the mountains in the summer and skiing the rest of the year. She believed herself a different person in the thin air of higher elevations. Her body would do anything she asked it to do. Life on the mountains was thrilling, as far from her mother's quarrelsome salon as it was possible for her to get. Lucia preferred nature's realm, climbing solo, nothing between her and the mountain, no one to rely on except herself. She skied competitively until she was sixteen and took a bad fall, shattering her leg badly enough so that on damp days her bones ached. The leg remained weak, so her racing days were ended and technical climbing was too difficult. She no longer had fluidity of movement, and she was the same person in the crystal air of higher elevations as she was on the flat.</p>
<p class="follow">All this time her mother dreamed of Prague, knowing they could never return. Her mother deemed the ski accident fortuitous since Lucia could now concentrate on her studies. Alas, she was an indifferent student, playful in the classroom, popular with boys. Her mother urged her to take music lessons, as there was a Czech proverb that asserted that whoever was Czech was also a musician. But Lucia was unable to carry a tune; piano, then violin lessons were useless. As a further insult Lucia insisted she had no interest in politics, a distinctly Swiss attitude. Her mother smiled bravely and said not to worry, Lucia was Czech through and through whether she liked it or not. Her Czechness would assert itself at the proper time. Czechness was not a suit of clothes to be discarded on a whim. Czechness was bottomless and forever. Lucia had an adolescent's answer to that: her mother did not understand her.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">Fifteen minutes later there was silence in the garden next door except for the sounds of Charles clearing away glasses. Lucia heard a noise and looked up to see her American husband at their back door. Alec looked so large, a giant almost. She said something to him and did not realize until the words were out that she had spoken in German. He seemed not to notice, late as usual, smiling apologetically. He had brought her a pretty bouquet of yellow tulips wrapped in cellophane. Upstairs the baby began to fuss. Alec laughed and said, Are you just sitting here in the dark? What's going on? Is anything wrong? She turned her head toward the stake fence but did not speak because suddenly her mouth was full of tears.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia hoped that one day an invitation would arrive, and one day one did, hand-delivered by Charles. That afternoon she went to the dress shop on Wisconsin Avenue, the fashionable one everybody went to, and bought a black shift. She had her hair washed and cut and ordered up a manicure. She bought a new pair of shoes. Lucia stood in front of the mirror for many minutes trying to decide if her mother's Lalique gold choker would be suitable and decided that it was quite suitable. She asked Alec please, please not to be late that evening. Will you promise me? It means so much. You can tell them our baby's sick with grippe. Mathilde's running a fever. They were invited next door, six-thirty <span style="font-size: smaller">P.M.</span> sharp, the Count and Countess d'An requested the pleasure of their company for cocktails.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">Welcome to the Salon des Refusés, the count said with lifted eyebrows.</p>
<p class="follow">We are very happy you can be with us.</p>
<p class="follow">We are neighbors after all. It is time to be neighborly.</p>
<p class="follow">Most of the other guests had arrived—Alec had not been prompt after all; the president had decided to call a news conference and he had caught the assignment—and were visible in the garden through the French doors, open at the end of the long room. It was furnished like a country house in middle Europe. A stag's head dominated one wall, smaller heads of roebuck hung left and right. Here and there were landscapes, romantic vistas of mountains and forests, streams disappearing into valleys. The artworks were as mixed up as middle Europe itself, a Caspar David Friedrich next to a Kandinsky, Max Liebermann beside Klee, and a supple line drawing that could have been Matisse or Picasso, hard to tell which. Lucia was entranced by the look of the place, especially the preposterous stag's head. The interior was dark, light bulbs concealed behind heavy opaque lampshades. The stag was poised above an enormous fireplace, large enough for a man to stand upright with space left over for his top hat.</p>
<p class="follow">We are happy to meet you at last, Lucia said in French. The count's nationality was unknown to her. His accent gave no hint. He was of medium height and build, dressed in twill trousers, a blue blazer with silver buttons, and an ascot. The count had the assured manner of an aristocrat but Lucia suspected he was a bit of a roughneck. His hands were huge with knuckles the size of marbles, a gold signet ring on his right pinkie. His eyes were black as a Gypsy's. His age was somewhere between forty-five and sixty. She did not know why she had spoken French to him and then she noticed in his lapel the rosette of the Légion d'honneur. No doubt she had seen it subliminally. Of course the Légion d'honneur could be given to anyone for anything—successful winemaking, successful literary endeavors, or unspecified but surely successful services to the state.</p>
<p class="follow">My father shot it, the count said, pointing at the stag. It is hideous but I like it. The countess likes it not so much. But she puts up with it.</p>
<p class="follow">Where was it shot? Alec asked.</p>
<p class="follow">On one of our mountains, the count said. I forget which one.</p>
<p class="follow">My father was a beautiful shot, he added.</p>
<p class="follow">Beautiful shot, beautiful horseman. He died in the war.</p>
<p class="follow">Come, the count said, and guided them down the long room and through the French doors into the garden, bathed in soft light from the torchères. The night was warm with only a breath of a breeze. Alec and Lucia were introduced to Herr Doktor Professor Anwalt, Maître de La Goue, General Symjon, Ambassador Kryg, the linguist Madame Brun, and half a dozen others whose names flew by. Lucia counted two beards, one goatee, and four wire-rimmed eyeglasses. The women tended to be slender except for Madame Brun and her companion, both stout as tree stumps. One boxy jacket belonged to a thick-bellied Bulgarian, identified as a second secretary at the embassy, aggressively drinking a highball; he wore a little red star in his lapel and looked to be spoiling for an argument. Ronald diAntonio waved at them from his place beside the great cedar. Alec and Lucia took flutes of champagne from Charles's silver tray and followed the count and countess. The count explained that they liked to throw a wide net for their parties, including both the oppressors and the oppressed, the commissars, the refuseniks, and anyone in between.</p>
<p class="follow">They should get to know one another.</p>
<p class="follow">Unfamiliarity breeds contempt.</p>
<p class="follow">Somewhere about was one of Franco's henchmen, and nearby the woman they all called La Niña, a disciple of the venerated revolutionary La Pasionaria. All this was said with the barest hint of sarcasm. And then Ambassador Kryg was at their elbows and the count took Alec away to meet the Bulgarian. Bemused, Alec followed the count, met the Bulgarian, continued on, thinking all the while that Washington was his city, the city where he grew up and went to school. He knew the names of the Iowa congressional delegation and the woman who ran the brownstone brothel way out Sixteenth Street and the chairman of the English department at St. Albans School and the son of the D.C. police chief and Lyndon Johnson's daughters, but he did not know a person in this garden with the exception of Ronald diAntonio. He had never been in a place where the company was exclusively foreign-born. He thought to himself that if he listened carefully he might learn something. Alec took a fresh glass of champagne from Charles's tray and glanced back to see Lucia listening intently to Ambassador Kryg. Then the count was telling another droll story, this one about General Symjon and his collections of antique firearms and French postcards.</p>
<p class="follow">Dear lady, the ambassador said to Lucia, what a beautiful choker.</p>
<p class="follow">Thank you, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Is it Lalique?</p>
<p class="follow">It was my mother's, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Most rare, the ambassador said.</p>
<p class="follow">You are very kind, Ambassador.</p>
<p class="follow">Dear lady, it is a pleasure to meet you at last. We have a friend in common.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia was startled. They had never met before and when she was introduced, her name was given only as Lucia.</p>
<p class="follow">Your father, the ambassador said. Andre Duran. But I have not seen him recently.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia let a breath go by and did not reply.</p>
<p class="follow">I saw him in Trieste, the ambassador said.</p>
<p class="follow">He disappeared years ago, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Disappeared?</p>
<p class="follow">Vanished, Lucia said.</p>

<p class="follow">Dear lady, I am so sorry. I have distressed you. I had to speak, the ambassador said. Such a strange coincidence, seeing you here of all places.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia said, How did you know?</p>
<p class="follow">Well, he said, and seemed to blush.</p>
<p class="follow">No, she said, tell me. I want to know.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre said he had a daughter called Lucia.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia is a common name, she said. You must do better than that, Ambassador.</p>
<p class="follow">Well then, he said, and gave an embarrassed laugh. Ambassador Kryg was short, barely over five feet. He too wore the rosette of the Légion d'honneur in his lapel and also a heavy copper bangle on his left wrist of the sort that was said to combat arthritis. A neatly barbered goatee and heavy horn-rimmed glasses completed the ensemble. Ambassador Kryg laughed again and threw up his hands in mock defeat. Dear lady, you look exactly like him, the way you walk, your gestures, your smile, your dimples. I am bound to say, even the freckles.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia was silent. She had no idea.</p>
<p class="follow">A quite remarkable resemblance. When I saw you I was in no doubt.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia could not think what to say. She was suspicious of this Kryg, so ingratiating, so eager to meet her and share his information about her father. She stepped back, searching the garden for Alec, and discovered him deep in conversation with two men she had not met. She tried and failed to catch his eye. She said finally, Was my father in good health?</p>
<p class="follow">This was some years back, the ambassador said. I would say his health was normal.</p>
<p class="follow">Normal? What does that mean?</p>
<p class="follow">I think he had been through very much. He was tired. It is normal.</p>
<p class="follow">What had he been through, Ambassador? And why was he in Trieste?</p>

<p class="follow">I cannot say. The ambassador raised his shoulders and let them fall. I'm afraid I cannot remember. I believe he was in business.</p>
<p class="follow">What exactly did he say about me?</p>
<p class="follow">He said that you were most attractive. That you had been apart but that he planned to visit you very soon. I believe he said it was difficult for him to travel.</p>
<p class="follow">My father is dead, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">I am sorry to hear it, the ambassador said.</p>
<p class="follow">He died many years ago.</p>
<p class="follow">Your father was much admired.</p>
<p class="follow">By whom? Who admired him?</p>
<p class="follow">The ambassador smiled thinly, his affability not what it had been. Andre Duran was admired by everyone who knew him, dear lady.</p>
<p class="follow">And which country do you represent, ambassador?</p>
<p class="follow">Czechoslovakia, he said. But that, too, was many years ago. I am retired.</p>
<p class="follow">At that, the countess swept Lucia away to join a nest of women gathered around General Symjon and Madame Brun. Lucia, stunning in her short-skirted shift and gold choker, was soon the center of attention. Alec had finished a third glass of champagne and was working on his fourth, utterly at sea in this company. He remembered reading somewhere that exiles by definition led interesting lives, had biographies worth knowing. But this group had proved elusive. He watched Lucia telling some story. He supposed it was a Swiss story but whatever it was everyone laughed at the end of it and Lucia beamed as if she were taking a curtain call. Alec found himself with Professor Anwalt and the writer Koch, both speaking English for his benefit. They were discussing another writer, Walta Bin-yameen, a formidable soul who had evidently met a tragic end seeking exile in Spain during the war. Had Alec read his work? No, Alec had not. Do so without delay, Professor Anwalt said as the writer Koch nodded solemnly and added that Bin-yameen's ambition was to be the greatest literary critic ever to write in the German language; and he succeeded. And then the champagne disappeared and, as if at the chime of a clock, everyone began to leave. The party was over.</p>
<p class="follow">We must do this again, the count said at the door.</p>
<p class="follow">I can't remember when I've had a better time, Lucia said. Your party reminded me so much of home.</p>
<p class="follow">I suspect we are a change of pace, the count said. Something different from what you're used to. Everyone was on good behavior tonight, even Madame Brun. She has a sharp tongue. Sometimes there are terrible arguments. People almost come to blows. Political differences, cultural differences, memories that are irreconcilable. They have grievances. You could call it a clash of civilizations except it's the same civilization, mostly.</p>
<p class="follow">Kryg was not on good behavior, the countess said.</p>
<p class="follow">Oh, no, Lucia said, it was nothing.</p>
<p class="follow">What did Kryg say? the count asked.</p>
<p class="follow">He made an uncalled-for remark about Lucia's father.</p>
<p class="follow">I didn't mind, really, Lucia said. It was innocent enough.</p>
<p class="follow">Kryg is never innocent, the count said.</p>
<p class="follow">What's all this about? Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">It's nothing, Lucia said. The ambassador knew my father years ago. I was startled when he brought it up. I didn't expect it. My father was the furthest thing from my mind. I hardly think of him at all anymore. She turned to the count and countess and added, He left my mother when I was a small child. I never saw him again and I have no memory of him. He is dead many years.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm sorry, the count said. Kryg is often tactless.</p>
<p class="follow">He's a brute, the countess said.</p>
<p class="follow">Unreliable, the count agreed.</p>
<p class="follow">Kryg said I looked exactly like my father. Even the freckles. That was a surprise.</p>
<p class="follow">Poor darling, Alec said.</p>

<p class="follow">Nonsense, Lucia said. I thought your party was wonderful, even Kryg. I can't remember the last time I met so many—she laughed brightly—vivid personalities. Next time you must come to us.</p>
<p class="follow">Alas, the count said, I rarely leave my house.</p>
<p class="follow">He won't go anywhere! the countess cried. He's hopeless!</p>
<p class="follow">You only have to climb over the stake fence, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Stop it, Alec. She knew he had taken too much champagne.</p>
<p class="follow">It's an ordinary fence.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">You could vault it if you wanted to, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">The count laughed at that and wished them good evening.</p>
<p class="follow">Later that night, Alec asleep, Lucia reprised her conversation with Ambassador Kryg. She had no idea she resembled her father. Her mother had but a single photograph, her father seated at a café table in Prague wearing a dark suit and a Borsalino, his head turned as if greeting someone. In profile he was hard-featured, a rough-cut young man with a low forehead, built like a bull, no freckles. He held an unlit cigarette in his right hand. Lucia had no personal memory of him. He had never been in her life. When she was fifteen her mother told her he was dead but did not say how or where he died. Her attitude was, Good riddance. Lucia did not press for explanations. It was then that her mother gave her the photograph. Your father looking his best, she said, and smiled, something she never did on the rare occasions when she spoke of him. God, she said. God, he was a good-looking man. All the girls wanted him.</p>
<p class="follow">Then Lucia remembered something Kryg had said. She was certain of very little in her father's life except for one thing: he had never been in business.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">The Count d'An was a man around whom rumors collected. His money was said to come from tin mines in Bolivia or a ranch in the Transvaal or the diamond trade in Amsterdam. Alternatively he was penniless and kept afloat by his wife, who owned estates in the Balkans. He never talked about the sources of his wealth, the common trait—as Alec helpfully pointed out—of old money and criminals. The count and countess had only recently arrived in Washington, and no one knew from where. But they seemed to know everyone. Whatever he did and wherever he came from, the count had the gift of hospitality. He and his countess—she as refined as he was blunt—were the soul of courtesy, easy and at the same time aloof. Looking at him, his muscular build and his bright Gypsy eyes, Alec thought of the seen-everything faces at the newspaper. The count would be good at games, good at getting in and out of scrapes. Not easily fooled. Not good at distinguishing one mountain from another. Very good at aura. When Alec asked his father about the count, the senator shook his head and said the name meant nothing to him. Alec searched the newspaper's morgue but found only one reference. The Count and Countess d'An had been among the patrons of a fashionable equestrian event near Baltimore, proceeds to benefit the Girl Scouts. Beyond that, a blank slate.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec and Lucia went frequently to the garden next door. The count and countess were now Paul and Marie. Lucia believed she had found a parallel world in their company. She thought of it as an underworld—not Virgil's, not Al Capone's, perhaps something resembling the depths of the ocean explorer Cousteau. Evenings in the garden were fluid, slow-motion theater, a form of escape. There was a shifting cast of characters because the exiles often brought friends, a visiting parliamentarian or intellectual or anonymous someone who had crossed a border and shown up unannounced in Washington. Second-tier intellectuals from second-tier countries, according to Alec, but often interesting and attractive nonetheless. He meant exotic. They had spirit but were in no way lighthearted. In fact they were hard going. Difficult personalities, Alec said, and Lucia reluctantly agreed. Listening to them investigate the past, she did not always understand the references: names flew by and she did not know whether they were politicians or writers because they were usually described in the language of literary theory, the objective correlative, narrative line, sentimentalism, prolepsis. The names meant nothing to her, the Czechs Novotny and Slánsky, the Hungarian Béla Kun, and the Italian Antonio Gramsci. Now and then a life jacket would fall at her feet: Arthur Koestler. But Lucia listened carefully all the same, finding something indomitable about them because they had lived through terrible times and had survived. Life had dealt them very bad cards and they were playing the cards with aplomb but without optimism. She thought they were damaged goods because they had seen so much and suffered greatly and were now ignored by the wider world, irrelevant and without standing, a nuisance. They were forever writing something, a critical article or manifesto, a novel or a cycle of poems or an allegorical play. At the slightest provocation they would quote passages from memory, well honed from nights in coffeehouses and private parlors. Lucia believed they were trying to reimagine their personal histories and what lay in store, if anything lay in store, and in that way they were sympathetic.</p>
<p class="follow">Also, Lucia said, the men had beautiful manners. Yet grief clung to them.</p>
<p class="follow">One of the men said to her, We were born on the wrong side of the tracks on the wrong side of the world. She thought the guests-of-many-languages had acknowledged defeat. They were yesterday's men, speaking in the rhymes and riddles of the disenfranchised. They were searching for some place to call home, and this search was doomed to disappointment because they already had a home but the door to it was closed and locked. Searching for another was like searching for a fresh set of genes. Meanwhile the exiles stayed on in Washington, the seat of what they called the American empire, as far-flung now as Alexander's or Caesar's. Since the assassination Washington had become tightly wound and bedeviled by theories of conspiracy—fertile ground, in other words, for the writing of a novel, a poem, or an allegorical comedy. These projects were begun but rarely completed. America was so large, so prodigious in its energies, so various, it was difficult for the exiles of small nations to grasp. The writers among them found themselves blocked, unable to move forward. Their material had vanished.</p>
<p class="follow">Among the exiles—and that was another difficulty, defining their status—refugee, exile, émigré, or displaced person—not from the point of view of American immigration law but their own sense of themselves. A few of them adopted (not without a sly smile) the German expression <em>gastarbeiter,</em> guest worker, except they were not guests and they did little work except for translations and the unfinished manuscript in the desk drawer. The Jews were the most reticent, as if what they had borne was unspeakable, a family calamity so private and distressing that it could be spoken of only among themselves, and no language they knew was equal to the task. At first Lucia thought that in their privacy and exclusivity the Jews were like the Swiss; she came to disown this opinion later. It was at one of the early soirees that she first heard the word "Holocaust" and was at once drawn in by unfamiliar place names, the hinterlands where the furnaces were located, Hitler's crimes set side by side with Stalin's and the accompanying argument over which were the more appalling, the signature crimes against humanity. Lucia was shocked into silence. The argument was tentative, the door to the awful room barely ajar; these were not stories for mixed company and certainly not with a glass of champagne in your hand, and in any case the need to forget and the responsibility to remember were in combat. Eichmann's trial had taken place only a few years back. Just once in Lucia's hearing did the argument spill over, reticence set aside in the passion of the moment. The linguist Madame Brun and Ambassador Kryg put down their champagne flutes and attempted to settle the matter. Perhaps settle was too strong a word. A settlement would not be reached that night or any night.</p>
<p class="follow">Madame Brun, half a head taller than the ambassador, spoke first. The uniqueness of the Holocaust was its specificity. Gypsies and homosexuals and a few communists were not excluded but the target was Jews. To be so selected was appalling. Guilt was not established. What guilt? There was no guilt except the guilt of blood. The terrible burden was borne mostly by Jews. That was what made the Holocaust monstrous, uniquely monstrous; that, and the industrial efficiency and civic enthusiasm the Germans brought to their task. Whole communities vanished, men, women, and children. Medical experiments, work dawn to dusk, the ovens tomorrow or the day after.</p>
<p class="follow">Dear lady, the ambassador replied, the uniqueness of Stalin's labor camps was precisely the lack of specificity. Anyone could be imprisoned, bad communists, good communists, fascists, loyal Russians, disloyal Russians, intellectuals, brutes, Christians, Jews; the net was wide. The imprisonment came at the whim of Stalin and his clique. No one was exempt. No one in the Soviet Union was immune from the knock on the door, the cattle car east, the pistol shot to the back of the head, the anonymous body in the gutter or floating in the Neva. <em>That</em> is the modern world, dear lady. Utter randomness. You must read <em>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich.</em> Solzhenitsyn calls it a novel but it is not fiction. I shall not mention the numbers, perhaps as many as thirty million souls, because as Stalin said, one death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic. When Madame Brun replied, her voice was a kind of hiss, a voice of profound indignation shadowed by infinite melancholy.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia turned away. She felt trapped on this corpse-strewn path into the past, and she was only twenty-seven years old, no scholar of history, no scholar of anything except the crystal air of the mountains. The Swiss were well known for keeping their noses out of other people's business, especially political business. Exiles in Switzerland were expected to conform or go away. The blind eye was a kind of national emblem, and if that meant peace at any price, well then, peace was the reward. When Lucia described the argument later to Alec, he listened with close attention and what seemed to be sympathy. When Lucia finished she was near tears. She could not remember having been so upset. Alec put his arm around her shoulder and said, We will never understand this. The Holocaust is outside our experience. The most we can do is look at the photograph and imagine ourselves inside the frame. It's a question of imagination. Of course there was sympathy. How could you fail to have sympathy. But sympathy never saved anyone from the hangman. The point was not to be complicit.</p>
<p class="follow">You're not, he said. I'm not.</p>
<p class="follow">I wonder sometimes if America is not a fool's paradise, Alec went on. But whether it is or it isn't, this is where we live. Our hats hang here. We are very far from Siberia or Auschwitz.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec, she said, that's so cold.</p>
<p class="follow">I can't pretend to an understanding I don't have, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">Mustn't we feel for them?</p>
<p class="follow">We can try, Alec said. It's insulting to them to think that we can succeed.</p>
<p class="follow">America was too large, she thought. There were too many people in it of too many tribes and languages; they would never understand one another. The definition of "understanding" seemed to be "success." And she, too, had turned away from the ambassador and Madame Brun as if their dispute were private, as perhaps on some level it was. She found it difficult to listen to them, their words so bitter and irreconcilable. Fate had placed them in opposition. It therefore came as a shock to Lucia when she concluded that, in some manner she was unable to account for, she belonged in the company of exiles. She was hearing a piece of music that was familiar but she had no idea where she had heard it before, unless it was her mother's European salon come alive once again.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">One night she left the party late. She had turned her ankle on one of the flagstones near the fountain and had been caught and helped to a chair by one of the new arrivals. Alec had not accompanied her to the party, preferring instead to watch the baseball game on television. Nikolas was attentive, had brought her a glass of champagne and ice cubes wrapped in a towel. He expertly wound the towel around her ankle and insisted she sit a moment. Allow the ankle to rest. They chatted briefly about the company before Lucia said she had to go home, she only lived next door. Her husband would be waiting for her. Nikolas helped her down the front steps and into the empty street. Paul d'An had lent Lucia a cane, but she was unsteady all the same and hurting. The night was very warm, the street silent.</p>
<p class="follow">I have not seen you here before, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">I've just arrived from Budapest, Nikolas said. They allowed me to come here and teach for a semester. My family remains in Hungary, my father and my sisters. My father is a Lutheran pastor, but of course he has no church so he has become a bricklayer instead, rebuilding someone else's church that will be used for another purpose, something not churchly.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia smiled weakly. She was tired and her ankle hurt.</p>
<p class="follow">I am a linguist, he said. Also, I am a historian of Marxism. And a novelist.</p>
<p class="follow">She smiled again, seeing a joke there somewhere.</p>
<p class="follow">The disciplines are not incompatible.</p>
<p class="follow">Like bricklaying and the ministry? She looked at her watch.</p>
<p class="follow">Not a bit, he said. Nikolas lit a cigarette and said Madame Brun brought him. She said Paul and Marie were convivial and their parties the center of things. She was not wrong. Still, I don't know that I like it here. I think I would rather be in Europe. Not Hungary. Hungary's finished.</p>

<p class="follow">Do you know Zurich?</p>
<p class="follow">Not well, Nikolas said. I have not had much occasion to be there.</p>
<p class="follow">Poor Zurich. Nothing happens in Zurich.</p>
<p class="follow">Einstein happened in Zurich.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, I'd forgotten.</p>
<p class="follow">And Max Frisch.</p>
<p class="follow">Who is Max Frisch?</p>
<p class="follow">Switzerland's greatest novelist. Also, he writes plays.</p>
<p class="follow">I don't know his work.</p>
<p class="follow">You have been away a long time.</p>
<p class="follow">Not too long. I suppose it's five years. She looked at her watch again, wondering if Max Frisch had been one of those who came to her mother's salon. The name was familiar. She remembered an elderly bald man with heavy round spectacles and an intimidating glare and wondered if that was Max Frisch.</p>
<p class="follow">The museum is good, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">Remember Café Voltaire? Where the Dadaists gathered, Jean Arp and the others. I always thought it funny that Zurich had a Dada scene. But maybe that was the place for it. The birthplace of Dada.</p>
<p class="follow">My mother liked to go there, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">And I remember a restaurant outside of town. We had to drive. We had a wonderful meal—</p>
<p class="follow">She said, Chez George.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, that's the one.</p>
<p class="follow">My mother and I often went there for Sunday lunch. Zollikon was the name of the town. The lake is nearby, in the summer filled with boats. Chez George served quail eggs.</p>
<p class="follow">You'll be glad to know it's still there. At least it was six months ago. I and a colleague were making a presentation at the university and the rector took us to lunch, three courses with wine. I have never eaten such food before. The dining room was quite formal and I'd neglected to bring a tie. It never occurred to me. The maitre d' lent me one so that I would be properly dressed and not stand out. Not feel like a—the Americans have a word for it.</p>
<p class="follow">Yokel, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, yokel.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia said, Once a month we would go to Chez George by the lake, my mother and I. The Sunday treat, she called it. When I was young she always let me have a taste of her pilsner. The chocolate deserts were sublime.</p>
<p class="follow">I think you miss it, Nikolas said.</p>
<p class="follow">I do, she said. I hadn't realized I did. My mother is gone now.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm sorry, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">She had terrible cancer, Lucia said. She was very ill. Her death was a blessing to her. Perhaps not to me. I miss her.</p>
<p class="follow">My mother is gone also. But she died in the war. The Russians.</p>
<p class="follow">How terrible, Lucia said. You must have been very young.</p>
<p class="follow">I was three years old, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">Only three, she said, my goodness.</p>
<p class="follow">I hardly remember her.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, she said. I can imagine.</p>
<p class="follow">You can imagine?</p>
<p class="follow">Yes. My father, when I was three.</p>
<p class="follow">Nazis or Russians?</p>
<p class="follow">He went away, and he was lost in the war. I don't know where. I have no idea how he died or where he is buried.</p>
<p class="follow">My father never recovered. I think he lost his faith.</p>
<p class="follow">My mother, Lucia began, but did not finish her thought. She did not know this boy well enough to speak of her mother's socialism, her salon, and the photograph of her father and the Borsalino hat.</p>
<p class="follow">So we have a European history, you and I.</p>
<p class="follow">I suppose we do, Lucia said.</p>

<p class="follow">Do you like it in America?</p>
<p class="follow">I suppose I do, Lucia said. My husband is American. I have a daughter, Mathilde. She is already speaking a little English and sometimes I talk German to her, nursery rhymes at bedtime. She looks Swiss, I think. My husband says she has a banker's face. Big cheeks and already jowls.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia leaned against the iron railing that led to the sidewalk from the d'Ans' stoop. She realized suddenly that both she and Nikolas had been whispering. The street was so quiet, not even a passing car. She had no idea how long she had been there talking to the Hungarian boy, who was not loud as Hungarians often were but quiet and serious, most polite, a shy manner. Lucia tapped her cane on the railing and said it was time for her to go home.</p>
<p class="follow">Will we see each other again? he asked.</p>
<p class="follow">If you come to the d'Ans', of course.</p>
<p class="follow">I have enjoyed talking to you very much, Lucia.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, it has been pleasant. But I forgot to ask. Did you like Zurich?</p>
<p class="follow">I did, he said. I like Swiss. I do not care for Austrians.</p>
<p class="follow">Nor I, Lucia said. They are very sure of themselves.</p>
<p class="follow">They're only Germans of another jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="follow">The Germans want everything, even Switzerland.</p>
<p class="follow">Well, Nikolas said, that's over now. The Germans are back in their cage.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia smiled. I feel foolish forgetting Einstein.</p>
<p class="follow">Everyone forgets Einstein, Nikolas said, and blew her a kiss as he walked away.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">As time went on, Alec and Lucia accepted only about one in three invitations to the garden next door. The ambiance had changed, many of the evenings marked by malaise owing to the stalemate in central Europe and the American preoccupation with Indochina. And there had been other unwelcome displacements. Madame Brun had died of a heart attack, the writer Koch of injuries suffered in a road accident. Ambassador Kryg had retired to Sardinia and General Symjon to Madagascar. There were new ambassadors and military men and a fresh parade of hopeful second-tier intellectuals. Nikolas was sometimes present, sometimes not. Everyone seemed to drink more, but the drinking did not bring hilarity. Even the arguments were muted, as if in recognition of their essential irrelevance. Frequently Lucia went without Alec, staying on for a nightcap with Paul and Marie after everyone else had left. It was there, one evening in the summer of 1967, that they told her they were leaving Washington and returning home. It was time. They felt they had outstayed their welcome. The assassination of the president had ruined everything and now there was a war growing more desperate each day. The war would surely end badly. How could America have gotten itself into such a mess? The French had warned them. The British and the Germans had warned them. But Lyndon Johnson and his cohort had refused to listen to anyone outside the charmed circle of advisers. They thought the war in Vietnam was a replica of the European war and it wasn't. There would never again be another war like the European war. Probably there was nostalgia for that war because so many of the senior American generals had fought in it. Hard to believe war nostalgia if you were a European, but that is what it is.</p>
<p class="follow">We have learned that Washington is a one-subject town, Paul said.</p>
<p class="follow">This war is not our subject, Marie added.</p>
<p class="follow">Next month it will still be the war, Paul said, but another facet of it. This war is like a diamond, many-faceted. It has the fascination of a diamond, too. The war will go on for years. That's what you have to look forward to, you and Alec. Even little Mathilde.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec's paper wanted him to go, Lucia said. He refused.</p>
<p class="follow">Good judgment, Paul said. I suppose they were disappointed in him.</p>
<p class="follow">He didn't say, Lucia said. I imagine they were.</p>
<p class="follow">She looked up then, above the stake fence to the second floor of her house. Mathilde's night light glowed dimly. In the sudden silence she thought she heard the crowd noise of a baseball game, Alec's evening television habit. She wondered if they were disappointed in him at the newspaper office. Alec said little about his daily routine except occasionally to point out one of his photographs in the newspaper, often complaining about how it had been cropped. He thought the photo editors had no sense of balance. The butchers, he called them, slicing up his photographs as they would slice up a side of beef. She did not believe he cared greatly for his work, yet he devoted long hours to it. Alec said he had respect for the craft.</p>
<p class="follow">So we are returning to our house in Kleinwalsertal, Marie said. No war in Kleinwalsertal. There will not be another European war in our lifetime unless the Americans and the Russians have one, in which case the field of battle will be central Europe, bad luck for us.</p>
<p class="follow">It's hard to stay apart in Washington, Paul said. You become complicit whether you want to be or not.</p>
<p class="follow">It was fun in the beginning, Marie said.</p>
<p class="follow">Washington was full of charm, Paul said. Gaiety, too, in the White House and the embassies. That was because everyone was so young.</p>
<p class="follow">We hope you will visit us, Marie said.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, Lucia said. I will.</p>
<p class="follow">You have enjoyed our parties, Marie said.</p>
<p class="follow">Very much, Lucia said. I will miss you both.</p>
<p class="follow">You brought spark to our garden, Paul said. But now it's finished.</p>
<p class="follow">So many friends have passed on this year, Marie said. Died, moved away. It isn't the same as it was. Did you hear Ronald diAntonio was ill? I couldn't believe it. I always thought of Ronald as Peter Pan, never grew old, never grew up. But still, we were a part of things for a while. We couldn't have done it without our Charles. We asked him to come to Kleinwalsertal with us but he said he preferred Washington. He's going to work for the Argentines. We doubt he will fit in with the Argentines. Charles is very much fastidious.</p>
<p class="follow">You and Paul were the perfect hosts, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">Paul refilled their glasses and turned to look directly at Lucia. He said, I know the things they used to say about us. Me. That I was a fugitive from somewhere, living on Marie's money, Nazi loot, a tin mine in Bolivia. Fantastic stories. They amused us so we did nothing to correct them—not that we could have. These stories have their own oxygen and are eternal, like Nosferatu. Washington prefers the speculation to the fact, is that not so? The facts are too prosaic for them. We came here because we thought Washington would be exciting. With Mr. Kennedy we thought, At last! Something of the modern world. A fresh start, as art had a fresh start in Vienna in 1910 and Berlin in 1921, a new generation in charge. We saw a kind of renaissance, not only in America but in the West, and we wanted to be part of it or at least in the vicinity because Washington would lead the way. That's why we came.</p>
<p class="follow">We were foolish, Marie said.</p>
<p class="follow">Not foolish, Paul said. Perhaps naive.</p>
<p class="follow">You have not one ounce of naivete, Paul.</p>
<p class="follow">He laughed and gave a signature raised eyebrow. He waved in the direction of the long hall and said, We thought we were getting Kandinsky but instead we got Caspar David Friedrich. Perhaps naive is the wrong word. At any event, we were disappointed.</p>
<p class="follow">Lucia had been listening carefully, moving her eyes from Paul to Marie like a spectator at a tennis match. She said, Kennedy was only a politician, not an artist or a writer. He didn't want to build a new house, only to live prudently in the house he was given. Also, you didn't fit in. That's all. I don't either.</p>

<p class="follow">Paul smiled and gave a halfhearted shrug.</p>
<p class="follow">Marie said, Do you think you spent too much time with us?</p>
<p class="follow">Oh, no, Lucia said. This—she swept her hand in a wide arc—was my lifeline. From the beginning, I think. Something moved in Lucia's memory, elusive as a shadow. She couldn't grasp it and then she did and began to laugh. She said, Tell me one thing. Who was Leisl?</p>
<p class="follow">Paul said, Why are you asking about Leisl?</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, you never knew Leisl, Marie said.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm almost embarrassed to say, Lucia said. I was eavesdropping one night, before we even knew each other. Sitting in my garden and listening to the conversations and envious because I wanted to be there, too. And I heard two women talking about Washington. Washington's vulgarity. That was the word they used but what they meant was anti-Semitism. Leisl was the one who liked Washington and did not think it vulgar. Her friend disagreed.</p>
<p class="follow">That was her sister, Hana, Marie said.</p>
<p class="follow">You shouldn't eavesdrop, Lucia.</p>
<p class="follow">I know. But I did. It was hard not to. We are right next door after all.</p>
<p class="follow">Hana went back to Israel, a kibbutz near the Sea of Galilee. She said Israel was where she felt safe. Leisl remained in Washington. She was gifted in languages and I believe she worked for the Israeli embassy. Maybe one of the other embassies, I don't remember. We lost track of her. Paul took a cigarette from his pocket and lit it, the smoke curling into the night air. A year ago we heard some boys tried to hold her up. It was early evening, not far from here. One of the boys had a knife. Leisl handed them her purse, urging them to take it and not to hurt her. But the effort was too great for her. She dropped dead of a heart attack. The boys ran away and the purse was later found in a trash bin. All this was reported by a neighbor who saw it all from her living room window. The neighbor saw Leisl hand over the purse and drop to the ground. The boys never touched her. The neighbor believed she was frightened to death.</p>
<p class="follow">Leisl was a gentle soul, Marie said. She always wanted to believe the best.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm so sorry, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">The sisters were very close, Marie said, but as different as chalk from cheese. If Hana saw an abyss she'd spit into it. Leisl would say a prayer as she balanced on the edge of it.</p>
<p class="follow">Paul said, Washington may not be vulgar but it is unspeakably violent. And not only on the streets.</p>
<p class="follow">They were silent then, Paul pensively smoking and Marie and Lucia looking into the darkness. At last Paul reached for the champagne and poured the last of it into their glasses. He had fetched a bottle of Dom Perignon for their final evening together.</p>
<p class="follow">We had hoped to see Alec tonight, Paul said.</p>
<p class="follow">Working late, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">He likes his newspaper, doesn't he?</p>
<p class="follow">He loves the office, Lucia said.</p>
<p class="follow">A Washington dilemma, Paul said, and they all smiled. Leisl was still with them.</p>
<p class="follow">I think he likes making photographs and the office is where they go to.</p>
<p class="follow">At least he isn't chasing women, Paul said.</p>
<p class="follow">No, he isn't chasing women.</p>
<p class="follow">I think Alec is a little bored with us, Paul said. I don't blame him. Our milieu is most particular, not for everyone. A milieu of misfits.</p>
<p class="follow">I hope everything is all right between you and Alec, Marie said.</p>
<p class="follow">Oh, yes, Lucia said offhandedly, as if she were replying to a question about the weather.</p>
<p class="follow">Good, Marie said. That's good.</p>
<p class="follow">Let's hope we meet again very soon, Paul said.</p>

<p class="follow">They walked her to the door, pausing to look again at the preposterous stag's head; it would fit in nicely at the ancestral <em>schloss</em> or whatever it was in Kleinwalsertal. They kissed goodbye at the door.</p>
<p class="follow">Take care of yourself, Lucia, Paul said.</p>
<p class="follow">She walked the few feet to her house, vaguely troubled by Paul's farewell. "Take care of yourself" was not an expression that came naturally to him. In her kitchen she found Alec watching the baseball game. He looked up in surprise when she told him that the d'Ans had sold their house and were returning to Europe. Alec said he was sorry to hear it. He knew how much their friendship had meant to Lucia. Your home away from home, he said, his eyes drifting back to the television set, an ugly argument on the field, catcalls from the bleachers. No more second-tier intellectuals, Alec added, and Lucia agreed with him: No more second-tier intellectuals. Alec was drinking a beer and she reached down for the glass and took a sip. She put her hand on his shoulder and kissed the top of his head, the place where the bald spot was. He didn't know it was there and she saw no reason to tell him. Premature, she thought, a premature bald spot, and there was nothing to be done about it. Wasn't prematurity always a lost cause? Alec was wearing his hair longer, sideburns that fell below his earlobes, a shaggy look she liked. He smelled of the darkroom and she liked that, too. Lucia stood quietly a moment, her hands on his shoulders and her chin touching his head, watching the argument on the field but thinking about her friends and how much she would miss them and their hospitality, the guests-of-many-languages, their worldly European flair even when they misunderstood things. Surely Paul knew better; Lucia had always taken care of herself.</p>

<p class="left">Paul and Marie were gone in a week. The new owners of the house next door were lawyers and not especially sociable. Construction began almost at once. The fountain was removed. The great cedar was dismantled branch by branch and a tennis court installed, the work taking most of the summer and through Thanksgiving, and when it was finished the thump of tennis balls had definitively replaced the conversations of the guests-of-many-languages, though only on weekends. The lawyers were much too busy during the week for sport. On the rare occasions when they gave a party it was a muted affair, and judging from the fragments of conversation, the guests were lawyers, intimate with the deliberations of Congress. Now and again they heard a familiar voice from Sunday morning television.</p>
<p class="follow">By Easter, 1968, Alec and Lucia had decided their own house was too small. Mathilde needed a larger bedroom and Alec wanted space for a proper darkroom. Lucia wanted her own study, a private place for her books and her stereo where she could play Mahler and Haydn by the hour while she wrote in her diary. And the absence of the towering cedar was disturbing. When they looked skyward at night all they saw was the hazy reflection of the lights of downtown Washington. Also, the thump of tennis balls on the weekend drove them to distraction. The lawyers found it necessary to loudly dispute line calls. Out. It was in. No, it was out. My side, my call. Bullshit. Bullshit yourself, sore loser.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec and Lucia found a larger place down the street, across from Admiral Honeycutt's house. The new house had three large bedrooms and space in the basement for the darkroom. Lucia took the third bedroom for her study, installing bookcases floor to ceiling. She bought state-of-the-art stereo components. She bought the novels and plays of Max Frisch and the works of the Romansh poets, determined to become current with Swiss literature. She wrote furiously in her diary each morning, recording the ordinary events of the day along with her thoughts about what she was reading. Once a week she read the tarot, to no clear result. She also wrote intimate poems, many of those in a code of her own devising, and then she abandoned the code to write in Romansh. They were long-line poems of a romantic inclination. From her third-floor window Lucia could see the summit of the Washington Monument and behind it aircraft drifting over the Potomac to National Airport—as in Zurich she had watched aircraft high above the Limmat approach Schaffhausen, reflecting sadly that the last time she had been on an airplane was the previous spring, two and a half hours to Bermuda, one week in the rain. She sat, feet up, composing her poems and watching the slow-moving aircraft and thinking of Zurich and the forgotten Café Voltaire and the waterside restaurant in Zollikon; like Leisl, she missed coffeehouses. On the wall behind her was the framed photograph Alec had taken so long ago, the day they met, Lucia in the doorway of the ambassador's office, his two children at her side, a mischievous smile present. Alec was not aware of it but she was looking at him and had been for a minute or more, wondering who he was and why he was photographing the ambassador. She thought he moved beautifully, like a dancer, the camera as much a part of him as his own two hands. She looked away, and when she looked back he was taking her picture. A single shot was all he needed. When he lowered his camera she saw his eyes, pale gray.</p>
<p class="follow">The new house had a large back yard with a garden at the far end, but the garden was not nearly so welcoming as the twelve-by-twenty space where the roses climbed the wooden stake fence and hung there in glorious profusion, white roses, yellow roses, five kinds of red roses, large and small roses that reminded Alec of the seen-it-all faces of his colleagues in the newsroom. This new garden was spacious as a prairie yet carefully manicured, fussed over, the dimensions all wrong. The garden was didactic, a schoolmarm's finger-in-the-face, violence at hand. It looked professionally laid out by a horticulturist who lacked humanity, an appreciation of asymmetry and chiaroscuro, the shock of the unexpected. The ensemble reminded Alec of anonymous passersby on any city street in America, banal as polka dots. He was profoundly disappointed and concluded that he and Lucia had made a terrible mistake buying this new house. Alec saw no way to remake the unfortunate garden, owing to the dimensions and what had gone into it. The garden put him in mind of a nation governed by a tyrant, and it was too late to put things right. Surely it was wrong to tear out the roots of perfectly healthy plants. They would have to live with a mistake.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec regarded his old garden with the greatest affection for the rest of his life.</p>
