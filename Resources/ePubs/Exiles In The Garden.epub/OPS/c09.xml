<h1 class="chaptertitle"><a id='bliopage262'/>MAINE</h1>
<p class="left"><b>H</b><span style="font-size: smaller">IGH HOUSE WAS BUILT</span> on a bluff that looked across Baylor's Harbor to a lighthouse. There were many smaller islands round and about, and at nine and twelve and three and six the high-bowed ferry arrived from the mainland; last boat off was at nine <span style="font-size: smaller">P.M.</span> It had been years since Annalise had been in Maine and she had forgotten how green it was, everything green and black-green with spots of yellow in the underbrush and on the surfaces of rocks. Maine was untamed. The house was a decade old and built on the margins of a forest, clear-cut looking south to provide a panorama of Baylor's Harbor and the open water beyond. A lone spruce stood dead center fifty yards out for perspective. The branches were widely spaced and bare to the tips, where nests of needles flourished. In early morning the nests of needles resembled floating islands, islands of the sky because their branches were obscured by fog. Now and then a gull floated out of the fog to appear on one of the branches. Except when the wind died, Baylor's Harbor and the thoroughfare beyond was alive <a id='bliopage263'/>with boats, some large, some so small that from the house you could see only the wake, a string of white on blue. At dead calm there were flat stripes in the water, gray in color and steely white where the flat spots were, a function of hidden ocean currents. At dead calm the ocean did not move at all, the only sensation that of depth and tremendous weight. Then, the water seemed to have an ominous potential behind an uneasy truce, the sense that in an instant and without warning the water could begin to heave and swell with who knew what consequences. Annalise and Alec looked up often from their books to watch the unsettled motion of Baylor's Harbor, judging the wind and looking to the west and southwest where the weather came from. Alec remarked that John Singer Sargent claimed that when he showed his portraits to members of his family, one of them always observed, Well, y-yess, but isn't there something wrong about the mouth? Baylor's Harbor was like that. Something wrong about the lay of the water.</p>
<p class="follow">High House (as it was called by everyone on the island) had a bedroom and bath on the first floor, a kitchen, pantry, and dining room on the second, and a living room on the third. The ceiling of the third floor was twenty feet high. The wall facing south had six high windows and a door leading to a narrow deck. The other walls were windowless, lined with bookshelves accompanied by a ladder hung on a rail attached to the ceiling. The owners had no interest in the island's interior and did not want to look at it. Their passion was the water, Baylor's Harbor and the thoroughfare beyond. Alec estimated there were more than two thousand books in the room, books of a certain age and character: three full shelves of mysteries and thrillers, McDonald, MacDonald, Cain, Hammett, and Chandler; Erskine Childers, Maugham, le Carré, McCarry; and elsewhere, floor to ceiling, Wodehouse, Waugh, John Wheeler-Bennett, Carlyle, Gibbon, Laxness, O'Hara, Charles Bracelen Flood, Mrs. Wharton, Mrs. Gaskell, Trollope, Don Marquis, Austen, Dostoyevsky, Edmund Wilson, Robert Frost, Yeats. The bottom shelves were for the children, full sets <a id='bliopage264'/>of the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew. The deck girdled the third floor but it was rarely used because the planks were not secure, well weathered with symptoms of rot, the ground forty feet down. On a low rise behind and aslant of the lone spruce was a squat cabin painted in now faded red and white stripes, a folly of the neighbors, transported log by log from Norway—Arctic Circle Norway, a fisherman's shack intended as a playhouse for the grandchildren until colonies of wasps nested. Heroic and continuing efforts to expel the wasps were unsuccessful. The interior of the cabin had not been entered for many years, so it sat untended and unoccupied, derelict.</p>
<p class="follow">In May the air was chilly, a biting wind most frequently from the west. The air was filled with seaweed and brine, bracing so long as you bundled up. The hills of the mainland were often obscured by low clouds that broke in the early evening, providing a spectacular sunset, a brief entertainment for the cocktail hour. Alec and Annalise took long walks in the morning and again in the afternoon; the rest of the time they read or played dominoes in the living room, conscious always of the weather and aware when a car or pickup truck motored by on the road to town. A Herreshoff came with the house, but Alec was wary of the tides and the unpredictable spring wind so he let the boat rest on its mooring, waiting for a sunny day with a benign breeze. Annalise thought the boat too small for two people, but Alec said it would be fine; the first good day they'd take it for a sail to the beach on the western side of the island, the one with sand instead of rocks and boulders the size of a small coupe. A good place to picnic, Alec said, a beach in the lee of the wind.</p>
<p class="follow">In the morning they walked the two miles into town for breakfast and it was then, on their third day, that Annalise announced that the script she was reading was junk.</p>
<p class="follow">Just awful, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">Send it back, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">It's work, Annalise said. I like to work. I enjoy the set. And the <a id='bliopage265'/>director and cinematographer are old friends. Best yet, they're shooting in Key West. Next winter, even better.</p>
<p class="follow">Who are you playing?</p>
<p class="follow">A whore with a heart of iron.</p>
<p class="follow">You've been there before.</p>
<p class="follow">I know. But I've always had fun in Key West. You could come with me, make some photographs of the filming. You've been idle for too long. It's not good to stay away from your craft, you lose your touch.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec did not reply. He was watching a red-tailed hawk circle the lighthouse, making great wide circles, riding the wind. He took the Leica from his pocket and squeezed off a shot, knowing the hawk was too far away. He lowered the camera and took one of Annalise in full pout.</p>
<p class="follow">You're distracted, she said. You were distracted last night in bed.</p>
<p class="follow">I was, that's true.</p>
<p class="follow">Most unlike you, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">Too much wine, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">Nonsense. Your mind was elsewhere.</p>
<p class="follow">Goya House, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">What's Goya House?</p>
<p class="follow">Alec had not told Annalise of his encounter with Andre Duran. He had not mentioned Lucia, either, because Annalise did not like her and was vocal about it. They had never met but Annalise had formed her own stubborn opinion, a matter of loyalty to Alec. Most hesitantly he described lunch with Lucia and Mathilde and his visits to Andre. He confessed he had been fascinated and unsettled by their conversations. He and Andre had led utterly different lives, opposing lives, you could say. Andre's was very far from a normal life. His was a life you read about in books, the ones with lurid covers. Of course their circumstances were different but Andre's experiences had given him standing along with an ardent sincerity that in another setting—say, the men's <a id='bliopage266'/>bar of a downtown club or a political rally or pulpit—would have translated into smug. He had presence, Alec said, built like an ox, brimming with energy, behaving like a man thirty years younger. Andre Duran was startlingly forthcoming. And he had been through terrible times, committing, by his own account, unspeakable acts. Probably a clever prosecutor could make him out a war criminal and Andre would not be a convincing witness in his own behalf, contemptuous as he was of any jurisdiction beyond himself. Remorse was not in his nature. In that way, Alec said, he reminded me of my father. Those in the arena lived by the arena's rules, always opaque to outsiders. Of course Andre was on the right side of things generally, a righteous warrior in the common struggle. His own experiences were the only experiences he trusted. Your experience or mine was off-book, not quite real to him. They did not exist for him and in any case were more or less expendable or valueless, like civilian casualties, collateral damage. Hard to know what to make of a man who so completely lived inside himself. Whatever private sorrow that went along with such a life was unknown, at any event unexplained. I believe he felt himself driven by fate. He had no say in the matter, assuredly a convenience in assessing the life he had led; he did what he did because he could do no other and left the assessments to strangers who were, naturally, unequal to the task. He was handed an assignment and he completed the assignment, no questions asked. Andre Duran was a locomotive on rails and the locomotive was called History. Alec said that his encounters with Andre had caused him to look critically at his own life, where assignments did not figure. What he found there was puzzling, an enigma. When he tried to remember his ambitions for himself when he started out he found he could not except for a vague desire to record daily life, its fundamental stillness, its pauses and silences and unexpected rewards. "Vague" was probably the wrong word. The correct word was "incomplete." You could not know everything about your own life or the life of anyone else. Surely there <a id='bliopage267'/>was a lesson somewhere in Andre's life and everyone had a secret store, a habit, of sorrow. Alec regretted nothing. Regret was not in Alec's nature.</p>
<p class="follow">They had paused in front of the town cemetery, an acre plot bounded by a rusting wire fence, ancient gravestones tilting left and right. Many stones dated from the eighteenth century and a few from the seventeenth. Alec wondered aloud what promise could have drawn people to this remote island, with all of the American South and Midwest open to them. What was their reward? A growing season of two months maximum, appalling winter hardships, dangerous navigation, and hostile Indians. Perhaps hardship was the point. In colonial times such a place would be fundamentally lawless, and that, too, would be an attraction for a man who had a certain idea of himself and a cast-in-granite vision of the life he wished to lead. Alec looked again at the gravestones and saw that most of the names were effaced, eroded by weather. Here and there he could make out a date and an RIP at the top of the stone. The place looked haunted.</p>
<p class="follow">They resumed their stroll into town, Annalise silent.</p>
<p class="follow">At last she said, I don't know what takes us into one business instead of another. I could as easily have been a dress designer. If I had been born ten years later I could have gone into politics, followed my father. I always liked the atmosphere of the committee room and even the floor of the House, the wheeling and dealing, the sarcasm. I liked campaigning. My mother hated it, so I was the one who showed up on the street corner or at the candidates' debates with my father, shaking hands and giving them a big wide smile. My mother couldn't disguise her distaste for it all, the handshaking and air-kissing. It's all so insincere, she said. But that's what I liked about it, the acknowledged insincerity. I didn't have to disguise anything. But in my junior year I joined the drama club and found I was good at it. And I was pretty, and that was a big plus. I photographed well. So instead of politics I went <a id='bliopage268'/>into acting. I always thought that if I'd met Ingmar Bergman and seduced him, then my career would have been different. I coulda bin a contendah. I coulda bin somebody. But I never met Ingmar Bergman or Bibi Andersson or von Sydow or any of the others, so I never got to dance on the heath with the angel of death. I never ate wild strawberries. So my career was as it was. Is, I should say, because I'm still working, still in demand, and a lot of girls I started out with are retired and living with their third husbands in Palm Springs. God, I hate Palm Springs. So let up on yourself, Alec. You're an honorable man.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre was fundamentally lawless, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Sounds like it, Annalise said.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm not, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Annalise smiled. I am, more than you.</p>
<p class="follow">You're in a lawless business.</p>
<p class="follow">That's its charm, Annalise said.</p>
<p class="follow">I wish you'd met him.</p>
<p class="follow">He doesn't sound like my type, Annalise said. You're my type. But what I don't understand is, what are you disappointed about?</p>
<p class="follow">Maybe I didn't take advantage of things.</p>
<p class="follow">You mean the war, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">Not only that, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">But the war was the main thing.</p>
<p class="follow">I knew people who were suited to the war. They had a high appreciation of ambiguity, for one thing. They actually liked the atmosphere of violence. Lawlessness, really. That atmosphere suited them down to the ground. I never liked it. I was never attracted to it. I think they saw in it a kind of romance, some high-flown sense of themselves in a world where everyone was watching. And this was true not only of the men but the women, too, everyone at ease in the butcher shop. Wouldn't life hold an exaggerated importance in such a situation? I was damned if I was going to the war as a good career move. The truth is, I never found <a id='bliopage269'/>an Ingmar Bergman I wanted to seduce or who I wanted to seduce me. I wonder if I missed something.</p>
<p class="follow">Annalise gave him a long look but did not reply.</p>
<p class="follow">We'll never know, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">I think you know. You don't want to admit to it. Everyone misses something in life. Andre did. I don't know what it was he missed and I don't care, but I know it was something and my guess is, he knew it, too. I know I wouldn't be content spending my last days in—what was the name of that place?</p>
<p class="follow">Goya House, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">Drinking schnapps and arguing about the soccer match.</p>
<p class="follow">He seemed entirely content to me.</p>
<p class="follow">In full reminiscence about the camps, for heaven's sake.</p>
<p class="follow">He's entitled to it.</p>
<p class="follow">He certainly is. And welcome to it.</p>
<p class="follow">That's harsh, Annalise.</p>
<p class="follow">That's life, Alec.</p>
<p class="follow">They ate breakfast at the café and read the Bangor newspaper, two days old but full of surprise crises—North Korea, the bond market, the elderly in far Downeast Maine who were so poor they were convinced that many others were even worse off than they. Alec and Annalise walked to the boatyard and watched the shipwrights at work, caulking and sanding and painting. Alec felt in his pocket for the Leica but did nothing with it. He did not want to be seen as a tourist looking for quaint local color. These men and women were working hard because in little more than a month the summer people would be back, all of them expecting their boats to be shipshape, rails varnished, hulls painted, engines tuned, sails well stitched. There were half a dozen radios in the yard, all tuned to the same music station, Bruce Springsteen from the sound of him. The air smelled of brine, oil, and sweat. Nondescript dogs prowled the premises. The day was not warm but most of the workers were wearing T-shirts and shorts, even the <a id='bliopage270'/>women. Alec thought there was something attractive about the ancient art of boat maintenance. Intrinsic procedures would not have changed since the voyages of Odysseus. This Maine archipelago bore some resemblance to the ancient Aegean if you discounted the weather and the vegetation on the islands, not to mention the color of the sea itself. "Wine dark" did not describe the waters of the Gulf of Maine. Slate gray was closer to the mark, at least on this May morning. By this comparison the summer people would be Myrmidons, the ones who laid siege to Troy; except that the families who arrived here from New York and Boston were not at all warlike, unless they arrived to find their vessels still in dry dock, and even then their complaints would be muted because the islanders did not respond well to threats. In any case, a Leica was out of place, not that the shipwrights would have minded. They were concentrating on the special tasks at hand. Alec did not wish to take advantage.</p>
<p class="follow">Annalise sat on an old dory writing postcards, and when she finished they both walked to the post office to mail the cards. When Alec checked for mail, the postmistress handed him a letter that had arrived that morning, postmarked Washington. He recognized the handwriting as Lucia's but rather than open it right away he put the letter in his pocket to read later when they were home. The long hike up the hill seemed to Alec more arduous than it had been the day before. Eyes down, he did not pause at the cemetery, and farther on the hawk had flown away. Annalise tried to pick up the pace but Alec's step was slow and his breathing hard. His feet hurt. The wind had come up and the air was abruptly chilly and filled with the promise of rain. Clouds gathered in the west and the gulls had vanished. They were passed by one pickup truck after another. Alec was relieved when High House came into view, whitecapped Baylor's Harbor below it. The high-bowed ferry had embarked for the mainland, rolling a little now in the long swells, its wake a confusion of white water. <a id='bliopage271'/>Home at last, Annalise put on a pot for coffee and Alec climbed to the third-floor room to read Lucia's hasty scrawl, long ragged lines, occasional illegible words.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p class="left">Lucia wrote that her father was dead. He was sitting in his usual place on the porch, at dusk, drinking schnapps. Something in the yard caught his eye and he stood, his hands on the railing. When he fell he took the entire balustrade with him. He fell like a tree, causing the house itself to shudder. That was according to Mr. Halvesi, who had been sitting with him. And there was no question that Andre was dead before he hit the ground. A heart attack, according to the doctor's report. The next few words were illegible but contained the word "miracle." Alec could not judge the context. Andre and Mr. Halvesi had been talking about a visitor earlier that day. Something the visitor said perplexed Andre. Was that visitor you, Alec? Mr. Halvesi thought it might have been. Andre was laughing at something you had said to him. He was still laughing when he stood to look for whatever it was on the lawn that caught his eye. And then he grunted and fell forward as if frozen, a statue. Since you seemed to take a liking to him I wanted you to know exactly what happened, Lucia wrote. The next two words were illegible. I am glad I had the chance to meet my father at last and I was looking forward to meeting him again, perhaps even in Europe. I wanted him to meet Mathilde especially, and of course Nikolas. I don't know why it should be that he would be taken from me only as we found each other after all these years. This does not seem just. I looked forward to many years of—and the next word was illegible. I wanted to know how he and my mother found each other. I wanted to know what my mother was like when she was young. Now I shall never know. By the time you get this the funeral will be over and done with. We will have a service at Goya House. One of Andre's friends was a priest, no longer part of the church but willing to preside. It seems my father had no religion but was very fond of the priest. It <a id='bliopage272'/>would break your heart, Alec, to see the look on the faces of my father's friends, Mr. Halvesi, Mr. Minh, Mr. Magris, and the others. They are broken up. One of them told me that my father was the center of their lives, the one they went to when they were troubled or there was some community decision to be made. They trusted his word. They trusted his good will. It was as if they were an ancient tribe that had suddenly lost its headman and was without direction or purpose. They were dismayed when I said I must take my father's ashes to Switzerland. They begged me to reconsider and allow him to remain at Goya House, where he had been happy. But he left a note that stated he wanted to be buried next to my mother in Zurich, so I was bound to disappoint them. I am very pleased he still felt something for her, that after all these years she was not a forgotten episode. He asked me specifically to carry his ashes to Zurich, so I was not a forgotten episode either. Mr. Halvesi found the note in Andre's desk, in his room. Dated last year. He knew he would find me. So I have comfort in that, too. Thank you for helping out, Alec. You must tell me sometime what you and my father talked about that morning. Whatever it was, I am very glad that his last day contained laughter. I will let you know if Nikolas and I decide to move house to Washington. I doubt it will happen. Be good to Mathilde.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec sat in his chair tapping the letter against his thumbnail. Annalise was standing with the coffee pot at the top of the stairs.</p>
<p class="follow">She said, What's wrong?</p>
<p class="follow">He said, Andre's dead, and handed her the letter.</p>
<p class="follow">Annalise read the letter and said she was sorry.</p>
<p class="follow">It's hard to believe, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">He was a very old man—</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, but he was the sort of old man who looked as if he had ten, twenty more years left. Of course there were the cigarettes and schnapps.</p>
<p class="follow">Do you really believe that was what it was?</p>
<p class="follow">No, Alec said. It would take more than that.</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage273'/>The camps, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, definitely.</p>
<p class="follow">I'm sorry I never met him.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, I am too. You'd be a match for him.</p>
<p class="follow">He was probably outside my realm, Annalise said. He was from another country altogether. I'm not sure we would have had much to say to each other. I'm pretty sure we would have been antagonists from the beginning.</p>
<p class="follow">Andre was outside my realm, too. But I liked him.</p>
<p class="follow">Annalise poured coffee and handed him a cup. She said, It's hard for me to be talking about someone I've never met. I know he's vivid to you. And you've made him vivid to me, but still. As I said, he's outside my realm. My frame of reference, I should say.</p>
<p class="follow">Sorry. I'll shut up now.</p>
<p class="follow">You don't have to shut up.</p>
<p class="follow">I think I'll shut up.</p>
<p class="follow">Are you sorry you missed the funeral?</p>
<p class="follow">No. Who do you suppose the priest was? A Central American, I'll bet, a liberation theologian. Maybe Spanish, a renegade from the old days. The service would have been conducted in Spanish, nondenominational in character. But I'll give you even money that incense was burning.</p>
<p class="follow">Did you ever photograph Andre? It would be easier for me if I saw his picture.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec tried to recall his last few moments on the lawn at Goya House. I think I did, he said. I don't remember clearly. I think I photographed him from the lawn. Not a formal shot, God knows. Two quick surreptitious snaps maybe, Andre asleep in his chair, breathing hard, lost to the world. But maybe at the last minute I didn't. I've never favored shooting people unawares. I had to do it when I worked for the newspaper. But I prefer not to.</p>
<p class="follow">I know, she said.</p>
<p class="follow">Invasion of privacy, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">Yes, of course.</p>

<p class="follow"><a id='bliopage274'/>Damnedest thing, I can't remember.</p>
<p class="follow">If you did, the film would be there.</p>
<p class="follow">That's true, he said.</p>
<p class="follow">By the way, I look on photography not as an invasion of privacy but a guarantee of it. It seems to me that I've been in front of a camera for half my lifetime. It's an old friend, just like you.</p>
<p class="follow">The telephone rang then and they both looked at it. Annalise was first on her feet and when she picked up her mouth broke into a wide smile. She said, Hellohellohello, how on earth did you find me here of all places? What's going on? She sat in the big leather chair, the phone to her ear, listening to whoever it was tell her how he had found her here of all places.</p>
<p class="follow">The foghorn had begun to growl at ten-second intervals, incidental music back of the wind. Alec rose with his coffee and moved to the glass door, stepping carefully onto the deck. The boards shifted under his feet and he avoided looking down. He stood staring into Baylor's Harbor, the boats straining at their moorings, wind whipping the water. The Herreshoff looked secure. There were six boats altogether, manacled like prisoners. Low scud came in on the zephyr wind and here and there Alec could see heavy black clouds above the scud. He had the idea that the wind was quartering and that could mean a three-day blow. Probably it would be smart to lay in provisions. Alec sipped his coffee and watched the sea turn and heave. Inside he heard Annalise's laugh, prelude to a change in plans; he knew it as he knew the effect of the quartering wind. The deck felt fragile to him and he stepped back into the doorway, out of the wind and drizzle. The weather disintegrated as he watched it. In a place like this your day was governed by the weather, the first thing you thought about in the morning and the last thing you thought about at night. In the city no one cared. On islands the weather was godlike and therefore inscrutable.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec remained in the doorway listening to the timbers creak and wondering what was next. He felt for the Leica in his pocket <a id='bliopage275'/>but did not take it out even though the striped Norwegian fishing shack was a wonderful flash of color amid the damp black and green, the more mysterious because it was uninhabited and had always been uninhabited. He thought of the interior as crowded with the ghosts of Norwegian fishermen tormented by wasps. Alec had a sudden hunger for his house in Washington, the familiarity of it, his wall of photographs and the rose garden in back, the former Alhambra next door. The garden needed tending. He had a tremendous urge to be in the garden at dusk, a drink in his hand, listening to the sounds of the neighborhood. The hell with Bloomingdale's. Behind him Annalise said something but a fresh gust of wind blew her words away.</p>
<p class="follow">Are you coming in?</p>
<p class="follow">In a second.</p>
<p class="follow">It's cold in here, Alec.</p>
<p class="follow">It's wild outside. Come look.</p>
<p class="follow">I can see from here, Annalise said.</p>
<p class="follow">Your kind of weather, Alec said.</p>
<p class="follow">It is not my kind of weather. Key West is my kind of weather.</p>
<p class="follow">He turned to look at her, her tousled hair and her face tanned by the Moroccan sun, her frown that threatened to break into smiles.</p>
<p class="follow">You've got to come look at this, he said. A schooner motored past the lighthouse and into the thoroughfare. Its sails were furled. Water crashed over the bow and the vessel heeled perilously to starboard. Annalise came to stand beside him, her arm around his waist. They could see the crew in bright yellow oilskins and the skipper at his big wheel in the stern, the skipper looking up to the rigging. By the set of his shoulders, the cock of his head and his raised right arm Alec knew the skipper was irritated, the storm at hand, the port a mile or so distant. The schooner flew behind one of the small islands and was lost to view. By the time Alec had counted to ten it was visible again and entering calm waters.</p>
<p class="follow">Alec thought he would give the island one more week, hope <a id='bliopage276'/>the weather improved so he could make one sail in the Herreshoff, a quick boat, responsive and reliable, wonderful to look at, lines as clean as a Matisse sketch. It had been a year or more since he had taken a helm. He would sail out of Baylor's Harbor to the western side of the island for a picnic with Annalise. And then he would return home to Washington to see what came next.</p>
