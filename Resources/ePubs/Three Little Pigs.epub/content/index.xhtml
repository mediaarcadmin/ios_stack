<h2>The Three Little Pigs</h2><br/> 
This is a story about three little pigs and  
a big, bad wolf.<br/><br/> 
The three little pigs were all pink and plump, and they all 
had curly whirly tails. When it was time for them to make 
their way in the world, their mother gave them a piece of 
advice. ‘Look after yourselves,’ she said, ‘and whatever you 
do, keep out of the way of the big, bad wolf.’ Then she gave 
each of them a goodbye nose rub, and off they went.</p><p>

The first little pig scampered along 
until he came to a pile of straw.<br/><br/>
‘Aha!’ thought the first little pig. ‘This straw is 
just what I need to build myself a cosy little 
house.’ <br/><br/> 
He set to work, and in no time at all his straw 
house was finished. He was just putting the 
finishing touches to it when who should come 
along but the big, bad wolf! <br/><br/> 
‘Mmmm,’ said the big, bad wolf to himself. 
‘That plump little pig would make a tasty 
mid-morning snack.’ And he licked his lips 
with his long, mean tongue. Then he walked 
right up to the little straw house, as bold as 
brass, and knocked on the door.<br/><br/> 
‘Who’s there?’ called the first little pig, and his 
curly whirly tail gave a curly whirly tremble.<br/><br/>
‘It’s only me, your friendly local wolf,’ his 
visitor replied. ‘Can I come in?’<br/><br/>
But the first little pig remembered his mother’s 
warning.<br/> <br/>  
‘No, no, no! Not by the hair on my chinny chin 
chin!’<br/><br/> 
‘Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll blow your 
house in!’ boomed the wolf.</p><p> 
 <br/> 
And that was the end of the first little pig.</p><p>

The second little pig scampered along until he came to a 
pile of sticks.<br/><br/> 
‘Aha!’ thought the second little pig. ‘These sticks are just 
what I need to build myself a cosy little house.’  <br/><br/>
He set to work, and within a few hours his stick house was 
finished. He was just putting the finishing touches to it when 
who should come along but the big, bad wolf!  <br/><br/>
‘Mmmm,’ said the big, bad wolf to himself. ‘Another plump 
little pig! Wouldn’t he make a tasty lunchtime snack?’ 
And he licked his lips with his long, mean 
tongue. Then he strode up to the little 
stick house, as bold as brass, and 
knocked on the door.<br/><br/> 
‘Who’s there?’ called the second 
little pig, and his curly whirly tail gave a 
curly whirly tremble.<br/><br/> 
‘It’s only me, your friendly local wolf,’ his visitor 
replied. ‘Can I come in?’<br/><br/> 
But the second little pig also remembered his  
mother’s warning.<br/><br/> 
‘No, no, no! Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin!’</p><p> 
 <br/> 
‘Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll blow your house in!’</p><p> 
boomed the wolf.</p><p> 
 </p><p> 
   <br/> 
And that was the end of the second little pig.</p><p>

You are probably beginning to wonder what the third 
little pig was up to. Well, he didn’t scamper off quite as 
quickly as his brothers. In fact, he sauntered along quite 
slowly, picking up a useful thing here, and a useful thing 
there. By the end of the morning, he had found a stack of 
bricks, a stack of roof tiles, some planks of wood, a box of 
tools and a big, red cooking pot.<br/><br/> 
The third little pig sat down for a while and made a 
plan. Then he set to work. <br/><br/> 
First, he dug foundations for his house. Next he laid the 
bricks. Then he sawed up the planks of wood to make a 
door, and windows with shutters, and rafters for the roof. 
Finally, he laid the roof tiles.<br/><br/> 
The third little pig stepped back to check his work.<br/><br/> 
‘Not bad,’ he thought to himself. ‘But I’m hungry! I’ll 
put the pot on the fire and make some supper.’ <br/><br/>
Soon a long plume of smoke could be seen rising from 
the house of the third little pig.</p><p> 
 </p><p> 
 </p><p> 
 </p><p> 
 </p><p> 
 </p><p>

<a name="7" id="7"/><br/>   
And soon the big, bad wolf — who, as you have  
probably guessed, was not very far away — sniffed the cool  
evening air and licked his lips with his long, mean tongue.<br/><br/>
‘Mmmm,’ the wolf said to himself. ‘This must be my lucky day. 
Yet another plump little pig waiting for a visit from his friendly 
local wolf! I think it’s time for a little early-evening snack . . .’ <br/><br/>
And the big, bad wolf came striding up to the door of the little 
brick house and called out:<br/> <br/>
‘Little pig, little pig, may I come in?’ <br/><br/>
But the third little pig’s curly whirly tail went completely 
straight with alarm and he knew at once that whoever was at 
the other side of the door meant trouble.<br/><br/> 
‘No, you may not!’ he said. <br/><br/> 
‘Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll blow your house in!’ 
boomed the big, bad wolf.</p><p> 
 </p><p> 
  </p><p> 
 </p><p> 
 </p><p> 
  </p><p> 
  </p><p> 
  <br/><br/></p><p> 
<br/><a name="8" id="8"/><br/> 
And the big, bad wolf huffed and puffed and blew as hard as he could. 
But nothing happened. He could not blow the brick house down. In fact, 
he could not even budge a single brick.<br/><br/> 
Well, the wolf was furious, but he was not going to give up that easily. 
He stepped back a few paces and then ran at the little brick house, as 
fast as his legs would carry him. Just before he reached it, he 
hurled himself at the roof, but he lost his foothold and fell 
off backwards, flat on the ground.</p><p> 
 </p><p> 
  </p><p> 
 </p><p> 
 </p><p> 
  </p><p> 
 </p><p> 
<br/></p><p> 
<a name="9" id="9"/><br/>  
Inside the little brick house, the third little pig put a big 
pot of water on the fire, whistling merrily as he worked. 
Of course, this made the wolf even angrier. He took a few 
more paces back and then took another flying leap at the 
roof of the house, but his claws slipped on the shiny new 
tiles and this time he tumbled head first on to the ground.<br/><br/>
Inside, the third little pig whistled merrily as the pot of 
water started to bubble and boil.<br/><br/>
By now, the wolf was in a towering rage, but he had to 
wait a bit to get his breath back. When he had recovered, 
he charged at the little brick house and leapt towards 
the roof. This time he made it. He gave a roar of 
triumph, then he plunged down the chimney and fell 
straight into the cooking pot! And that was the end  
of the big, bad wolf.</p><p>

 </p><p> 
  </p><p> 
 </p><p> 
<br/></p><p>  
<a name="10" id="10"/><br/>  
The next day, the third little pig put up a sign,  
which said:<br/><br/>
<b>PIGS ARE WELCOME.</b><br/> 
<b>WOLVES ARE NOT.</b><br/> 
<b>VISITING WOLVES</b><br/> <b>WILL BE PUT IN THE POT.</b><br/><br/>
The third little pig had a long and happy life, 
and he was never troubled by wolves again.
