<p class="chapterHeadB"><span class="bold">How Did You Score?</span></p>
<p class="chapterHeadC"><span class="bold">Mostly A&#8217;s</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">You&#8217;re an ON-THE-RUN EATER</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">You have the local Chinese, fried chicken, and pizza places on speed dial. And they probably know your name and order before you&#8217;ve even said hello. Lunchtime consists of whatever salad bar the nearest deli has to offer, and just about everything else you eat is chow on the run. We get it&#8212;you&#8217;re busy. But trust us, you&#8217;ll feel a lot less frantic and stressed (and bloated) if you brave the kitchen every once in a while. Cooking doesn&#8217;t have to be hard, as you&#8217;ll see from our recipes. And you&#8217;ll find that some of your favorite takeout meals can be created at a fraction of the cost, in the same amount of time it takes for them to be delivered. And&#8212;most important&#8212;with nothing close to the calories and fat you&#8217;re currently consuming.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadC"><span class="bold">Mostly B&#8217;s</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">You&#8217;re a SUGAR FIEND</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">You were born with a spoonful of sugar in your mouth. You&#8217;d happily give up takeout food, frozen dinners, and all sorts of junk food as long as you didn&#8217;t have to sacrifice your daily sweet treats. There&#8217;s always something chocolaty in your cupboard, in your glove compartment, in your purse, and in your desk at work&#8212;just in case. And if you can&#8217;t finish a meal with something sweet, you almost feel a panic attack coming on. Although you know you have an &#8220;issue&#8221; with sugary foods, you feel powerless to resist. And that&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve worked out some super-rich decadent treats that will give you your sugar high, without the guilt-ridden low. With a teensy bit of effort, you can have your cake and eat it too.</p>
<a id="page27" />
<p class="chapterHeadC"><span class="bold">Mostly C&#8217;s</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">You&#8217;re a YO-YO DIETER</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Your appearance is important to you, so you make more effort than most not to totally pig out at mealtimes. Problem is, your self-restraint is so good you often skip meals altogether. Health aside, this ultimately has the effect of making your body think it&#8217;s starving, so it&#8217;ll hold onto any fat stores you have. Not a good idea. Time is also an issue for you. You often head out for drinks straight from work, and unless food is available, you&#8217;ll forget all about it and fill up on alcoholic empty calories. And watch out&#8212;because alcohol is packed with calories. What, you didn&#8217;t know that? We&#8217;re not suggesting you stop your social life and stay in&#8212;heaven forbid! But try some of our smart calorie swaps and super-fast meal ideas and you&#8217;ll soon find fitting into your skinny jeans is much easier.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadC"><span class="bold">Mostly D&#8217;s</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">You&#8217;re a COMFORT FOOD CRAVER</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">You love food and home-cooked meals. Some of your favorite recipes have been in your family for years, and just the smell of them makes you feel safe and happy. You&#8217;re also a modern foodie and love to sample the latest bistro. You have a pretty good idea about nutrition and how to create a flavorful, satisfying meal, but your enthusiasm for eating means portion control doesn&#8217;t enter your mind. Some of your cooking methods and ingredients are as antiquated as your recipes (it <span class="italic">is</span> possible to make mashed potatoes without a stick of butter and cream, you know). Fortunately, while our recipes cut down on calories, they never compromise on taste or comfort. Open your mind to some new ingredients and techniques, and you can feel cozy without looking like a plush teddy bear.</p>
