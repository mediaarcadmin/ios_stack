<h2 class="chapterTitle"><span class="bold">So You Want to Drop a Dress Size?</span></h2>
<div class="chapterEpigraph">
<p class="chapterEpigraphText">Join the club! Most women say they&#8217;d be happier if they could buy their jeans a size smaller, spare the horror of suck-it-all-in spandex supports, and drop that extra 10 pounds they&#8217;ve been toting around since the beginning of the holidays&#8212;circa 2001.</p></div></div>

<p class="pb">&#160;</p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText0"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstWords"><span class="bold">Contrary to media reports</span></span> we&#8217;re not all obese. Nor, thank goodness, are we all a size 2. The average dress size in the United States is 12. Only 33 percent of women are classified as obese, but 62 percent are overweight (ouch!), so we do need to control our eating. But despite the newspaper headlines, for most of us it&#8217;s not about a total body transfor-mation&#8212;we&#8217;d just like to get a little closer to our &#8220;happy weight&#8221; and feel healthy and attractive.</p>
<p class="para">It&#8217;s a reasonable goal, so why does it seem so hard to achieve? Because, girls, we&#8217;re kidding ourselves. All too easily we buy into the diet industry propaganda that tells us all our problems will be solved if we just cut out X or supplement with Y. We want to believe that weight-loss success comes only in the form of denying ourselves all things pleasurable. And when the inevitable happens and we fall off the diet wagon, we have the perfect excuse to decide that losing weight is impossible for us, and just give up.</p>
<p class="para">The fact is, whether you think you&#8217;re super-healthy and restrained or you acknowledge that your dietary halo needs a good polish, you&#8212;like all of us in the past&#8212;have probably been deluding yourself. What you think of as an occasional habit may well have become a permanent fixture in your life. That large latte and blueberry muffin you blithely scarf down most mornings? That&#8217;s 765 calories every day. Read it and weep. The bacon sandwich and can of Coke that never fails to cure your hang over&#8212;540 calories. The Friday night pizza&#8212;a whopping 1,000 calories. Fine from time to time, but if these are a regular part of your diet, it&#8217;s no wonder you think those skinny jeans have shrunk.</p>
<p class="para">You don&#8217;t have to consume junk food around the clock to put on weight. There are certain foods that are just too darn delish and tempting to resist, and the truth is you probably give in to them just a little more often than you admit to yourself. <span class="italic">Cook Yourself Thin</span> doesn&#8217;t want you to resist them either, just keep reading so you can cook or prepare many of them in a way that is far more delicious than the store-bought options, with a fraction of the calories.</p>

<p class="boxHeadA"><span class="bold">Fact</span></p>
<p class="boxTextNoIndent">Contrary to media reports, we&#8217;re not all obese. Nor, thank goodness, a size 2. The average dress size in the United States is 12.</p>

<p class="chapterOpenerText0"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstWords"><span class="bold">All we ask of you is a little effort</span></span> in the kitchen and some good old-fashioned honesty. Brace yourself&#8212;you&#8217;ll need to keep a food diary for a week. But don&#8217;t panic. This is not going to be one of those boring, document-keeping diets. And it&#8217;s the last bit of hard work you&#8217;ll need to do.</p>
<p class="para">So grab a notebook that&#8217;s small and stylish enough that you won&#8217;t mind carrying it around with you all week. Ditto a cool pen. Give yourself a couple of pages for each day and write the name of the day across the top of the page. Then, from the moment you get up until the minute you hit the pillow at night, record every last morsel of food or sip of liquid that passes your lips. This is super important&#8212;because, more often than not, it&#8217;s our more unconscious habits that get us into trouble. So that handful of tortilla chips at a cocktail party, the tiny slice of cake you had at a co worker&#8217;s birthday party, the little pieces of cheese you slice off every time you go to the fridge&#8212;they all count, because the devil is in the details.</p>
<p class="para">Be prepared to finish up with really long lists every day. This is normal. To help you get started, here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<div class="box"><hr />
<p class="boxHeadB"><span class="bold"><span class="smallCaps">MORNING</span></span></p>
<p class="boxTextNoIndent">&#8226; Glass of orange juice</p>
<p class="boxTextNoIndent">&#8226; Black coffee</p>
<p class="boxTextNoIndent">&#8226; 2 slices of thick white toast with butter</p>
<p class="boxTextNoIndent">&#8226; Banana</p>
<p class="boxTextNoIndent">&#8226; Large latte with a shot of syrup</p>
<p class="boxTextNoIndent">&#8226; Half a bag of licorice</p>
<p class="boxHeadB"><span class="bold"><span class="smallCaps">AFTERNOON</span></span></p>
<p class="boxTextNoIndent">&#8226; Chicken burger on a bun with mayo, salad with French dressing, French fries and ketchup</p>
<p class="boxTextNoIndent">&#8226; 2 Diet Cokes</p>
<p class="boxTextNoIndent">&#8226; 2 small cookies</p>
<p class="boxTextNoIndent">&#8226; A handful of chocolate chips</p>
<p class="boxHeadB"><span class="bold"><span class="smallCaps">EVENING</span></span></p>
<p class="boxTextNoIndent">&#8226; Half a large bag of tortilla chips</p>
<p class="boxTextNoIndent">&#8226; Half a container of hummus</p>
<p class="boxTextNoIndent">&#8226; One frozen lasagna dinner</p>
<p class="boxTextNoIndent">&#8226; 2 glasses of white wine</p>
<p class="boxTextNoIndent">&#8226; Cup of decaf espresso</p>
<p class="boxTextNoIndent">&#8226; Cup of rice pudding</p>
<p class="boxTextNoIndent">&#8226; Chocolate chip cookie</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent">When your diary is complete, give yourself half an hour to sit down and analyze it. Remember, this isn&#8217;t an exercise in feeling bad about yourself. On the contrary, it&#8217;s empowering. It&#8217;s the perfect way to identify what your tastes and personal must-haves are when it comes to food and how to make sure you still satisfy that culinary lust as you shrink in size.</p>
<p class="para">There&#8217;s no magic scientific formula for the analysis&#8212;but a few different-colored highlighter pens might come in handy. We just want you to scan your lists for patterns. These might be easy to spot (half a tub of ice cream, 9 p.m. weekdays) or less obvious (like the fact that you eat more when you&#8217;re cooking for your guy). Make a note of anything that occurs to you. It might be useful to highlight these and then add up the following:</p>

<p class="spaceBreak">&#160;</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1">&#8226; Any foods or drinks that show up every day</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1">&#8226; All alcoholic drinks</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1">&#8226; All non-diet carbonated drinks</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1">&#8226; All food bought and eaten on the run (like a sandwich)</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1">&#8226; All takeout meals</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1">&#8226; All meals out</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1">&#8226; Sweet snacks</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1">&#8226; Savory/salty snacks</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1">&#8226; Pig-out sessions</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&#160;</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent">Hopefully, you&#8217;ll see one or two patterns emerge from this process. You might discover that you tend to &#8220;graze&#8221; all day long, which can be perfectly fine if that means fruit for snacks and small portions at mealtimes, but start adding hunks of cheese and endless bags of chips to three average meals a day and you can quickly see why the calories might be adding up. Or maybe you&#8217;ve gotten into the habit of grabbing a candy bar every day at the same time. It&#8217;s a pick-me-up you now feel you couldn&#8217;t do without, but once you try the sinfully good Mint Chocolate Cupcakes (page 210), you&#8217;ll never look back. Many people eat pretty well during the week and then blow it all on the weekend on a few too many glasses of wine, takeout food, and massive brunches, while others are happy to spend time cooking wholesome meals during the weekend, but don&#8217;t have the time during the week. In the next few pages, you&#8217;ll pick up plenty of tips and tricks to help you pinpoint the easy changes you can make to cut your calories and start seeing the pounds drop off.</p>
