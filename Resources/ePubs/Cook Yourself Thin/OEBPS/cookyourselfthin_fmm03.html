<p class="chapterOpenerText0"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstWords"><span class="bold">Allison</span></span> is passionate about food&#8212;not just cooking and eating it, but also writing about and studying it. She understands the joy and pleasure of food from every angle&#8212;as an academic, writer, trained chef, and food lover.</p>
<p class="para">To share this passion she created a cooking school called The Wooden Spoon, where she and her team of instructors come to people&#8217;s homes, demonstrating for them the techniques and deliciousness of home cooking. She loves being able to help people become excited about food and confident and creative in their own kitchens.</p>
<p class="para">She has lent her talents as a recipe developer and food stylist to various magazines and television projects, including Martha Stewart, the Food Network, <span class="italic">Real Simple</span>, and <span class="italic">Glamour</span> magazines. As a former co-host of TLC&#8217;s <span class="italic">Home Made Simple</span>, Allison traveled the country showing families how to cook confidently in their own kitchens.</p>
<p class="para">Allison has a B.S. in human development and family studies from Cornell University, and a culinary degree from the Institute for Culinary Education. She&#8217;s currently pursuing a master&#8217;s degree in food studies from New York University, just a subway stop away from her home in Brooklyn.</p>
