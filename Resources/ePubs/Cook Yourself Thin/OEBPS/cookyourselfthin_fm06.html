<div class="chapterEpigraph">
<p class="chapterEpigraphText">If you&#8217;re female and you made it as far as your mid-teens without using the word &#8220;calorie,&#8221; congratulations! There can&#8217;t be too many body-conscious women out there who aren&#8217;t familiar with the term. But do we really know what it means? Time for a quick lesson.</p></div></div>

<p class="chapterOpenerText0"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstWords"><span class="bold">A calorie is basically a unit</span></span> that measures how much energy your body is able to get from food. Different nutrients in food provide different amounts of calories: for example, fat gives you about 9 calories per gram, alcohol 7, while carbohydrates and protein yield about 4.</p>
<p class="para">To find out how many calories a food contains, you can either consult our Calorie Guide (page 40) or check the nutritional information on the food label if it comes in a package. Remember to check the <span class="italic">number of servings</span> this refers to though. Most labels show nutritional information for one serving of the product. Even some seemingly tiny packages (like a small bag of potato chips) claim to contain 2 to 3 servings.</p>
<p class="para">Keep an eye out for fat content too&#8212;especially saturated fat. Anything over 3 grams of fat per 100 grams of food can&#8217;t be labeled as low fat. Anything over 20 grams and warning bells should go off. Health professionals recommend that women like us shouldn&#8217;t consume more than about 70 grams of fat a day. Remember, fat is packed with calories.</p>
<p class="para">The United States Department of Agriculture recommends a daily intake of about 2,000 calories per day for women and about 2,500 for men. Of course, this will vary depending on your size and how active you are, but it&#8217;s a good guide. Add up your food diary numbers and you may find you meet this level or even consume less on some days, while on others you eat enough for three of you. But contrary to the ideas behind many of the starvation diets we&#8217;ve all tried, losing weight doesn&#8217;t mean existing on a few hundred calories a day. Here&#8217;s a better way to think about it.</p>
<p class="para">Each pound of body fat you carry has an energy content of 3,500 calories. So if you want to lose a pound a week, the amount most experts say is realistic and safe, you&#8217;d need to cut your calorie intake by 500 calories a day (500 x 7 days = 3,500). We use this equation: your goal weight x 10 = the number of calories you can eat per day. Take a look at your food diary and see how many calories some of your &#8220;guilty pleasures&#8221; contain and you&#8217;ll see that cutting 500 a day is easier than you think. Add a little calorie-burning exercise (see page 73) and you&#8217;ll be shedding pounds before you can say, &#8220;Wow, that was easy.&#8221;</p>

<p class="chapterHeadB"><span class="bold">Buyer Beware</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Try not to get too excited if food packaging screams at you from the shelves that it&#8217;s &#8220;low fat,&#8221; &#8220;lite,&#8221; &#8220;less sugar,&#8221; or one of the many &#8220;buy-me-I&#8217;ll-make-you-thin&#8221;-type promises. When something boasts it&#8217;s 90 percent fat-free, what that means is that it contains 10 percent fat, which is hardly negligible. And remember that &#8220;low fat&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean &#8220;low sugar&#8221; (i.e., low in calories). If an ice cream bar says it&#8217;s &#8220;reduced sugar,&#8221; do you know how much sugar was in the original version? If the answer is enough to make your teeth fall out, chances are the reduced version is pretty caloric too. The simple solution to all this confusion is, of course, to reject processed foods as much as possible&#8212;definitely steer clear of &#8220;diet&#8221; foods&#8212;and get into the kitchen instead. And before you start protesting that you don&#8217;t have the time, just think how long it takes to decipher a food label!</p>
