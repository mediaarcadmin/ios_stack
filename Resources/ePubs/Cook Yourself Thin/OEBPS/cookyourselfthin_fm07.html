<p class="chapterEpigraphText">You know they&#8217;re supposed to be occasional treats that are hardly going to help you lose weight, but somehow you just can&#8217;t seem to resist them. Here we out some of the biggest offenders when it comes to calorie counts. The good news is you don&#8217;t have to give these up if you simply cook them the CYT way.</p></div></div>

<p class="chapterHeadB"><span class="bold">The Surprise Offenders</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Generally, we know when we&#8217;re indulging in a guilty pleasure. As you close your eyes and savor that first bite of rich, luscious, chocolate mousse pie, you know you&#8217;re not fooling anyone, least of all yourself. It&#8217;s a decadent thrill that tastes all that much better for being naughty. But what about those everyday foods that look so innocent? The trouble with so-called diet foods is they often taste bland and don&#8217;t fill you up&#8212;leading to the dreaded snack attack later.</p>
<p class="para">Sometimes, despite our most virtuous intentions, the calories just slip past our radar. You think you&#8217;re munching away on a super-healthy snack when you might just as well have had a buttery scone and be done with it.</p>
<p class="para">Some salty foods contain surprising amounts of sugar. Likewise, products that boast they&#8217;re &#8220;low fat&#8221; often compensate by being high in sugar. Don&#8217;t let foods like these fool you with their healthy fa&#231;ade. It&#8217;s not that they&#8217;re outright <span class="italic">bad</span> for you and that you should give them up&#8212;far from it. A fruit smoothie is a great way to get your vitamins, and olive oil has countless beauty and health benefits. Just keep your eye on them&#8212;it&#8217;s worth noting their calorie counts if these items crop up more than two or three times in your food diary.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadB"><span class="bold">The Main Offenders</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Alcohol&#8212;</span>It&#8217;s fun but full of empty calories, especially if it&#8217;s dark or sweet.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Cereal&#8212;</span>Sugary cereals tend to be higher in calories than high-fiber cereals and far less satisfying.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Granola bars&#8212;</span>They may look healthy, but check the label.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Frozen french fries&#8212;</span>Watch out for those coated in high-calorie seasoning.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Nuts&#8212;</span>They&#8217;re full of vitamins and minerals, but don&#8217;t overdo it. Choose raw over roasted.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">&#8220;Good oils&#8221;&#8212;</span>They&#8217;re a dietary essential, just watch how much you slosh on.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Peanut butter&#8212;</span>It&#8217;s good for you, but spread it thin.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Movie popcorn&#8212;</span>Smuggle in your own for a fraction of the calories and cost.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Deli sandwiches&#8212;</span>Watch out for mayo and other extras.</p>
<a id="page39" />
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Store-bought salads&#8212;</span>Dressings, croutons, fatty meat, and cheese can turn a light lunch into a calorie-laden pig out.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Fruit smoothies&#8212;</span>Go for fruity rather than yogurty and check for added sugar.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Soup and dressings&#8212;</span>Check for hidden sugar and cream, or even better make your own (see pages 102, 173, 192).</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Toast with butter&#8212;</span>It&#8217;s easy to OD on butter when it melts into the bread.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Veggie burger&#8212;</span>Extra fat is often used to boost flavor.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Yogurt&#8212;</span>It sounds healthy and often is, but some are high in fat and sugar. Check before you buy.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadB"><span class="bold">It&#8217;s Sugar, but Not as You Know It</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Food companies have canny ways of concealing a food&#8217;s sugar content from us. For instance, they&#8217;ll list different types of sugars separately. Check the label for:</p>
