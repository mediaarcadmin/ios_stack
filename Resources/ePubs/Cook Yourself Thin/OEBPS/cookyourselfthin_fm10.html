<p class="chapterEpigraphText">Good, fast, fuss-free cooking is all about the equipment you use. You don&#8217;t have to spend a fortune or clutter your work surfaces with appliances&#8212;we&#8217;re talking about a few choice pieces that will make your food lighter and your life easier. Here are CYT faves.</p></div></div>

<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Beautiful plates&#8212;</span>What&#8217;s the point of great-looking food on dull, chipped plates?</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Blender&#8212;</span>You won&#8217;t need this and a food processor and a handheld blender unless you&#8217;re an avid cook (with a big kitchen), but a coun-tertop blender is great if you often make smoothies and soups in large quantities. A glass container is a better investment than plastic. It comes in handy for cocktails, too!</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Immersion or stick blender&#8212;</span>This is handy for smaller quantities, such as making a soup or smoothie for one or two. It&#8217;s portable, doesn&#8217;t take up much room, and is easy to clean.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Hand mixer&#8212;</span>Like a handheld blender, this is portable, easy-to-clean, and saves aching arms if you&#8217;re whisking egg whites or making a cake.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Standing mixer&#8212;</span>If you love to bake, you can&#8217;t live without this workhorse!</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Food processor&#8212;</span>If you have room, leave this out on your kitchen coun tertop permanently and you&#8217;ll use it more often. Once you realize what a time-and labor-saver this is, you&#8217;ll fall in love. In addition to blending, pur&#233;eing and whisking, you&#8217;ll use it for cakes, making breadcrumbs, and whipping up toppings and spreads.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Ridged griddle or grill pan&#8212;</span>For grilling meat, fish, and veggies, this is low-or no-fat fast cooking with an extra smoky flavor. Those barbeque-style griddle marks make you feel like summer is with you all year round.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Paper towels&#8212;</span>They&#8217;re good for blotting grease off food after cooking.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Metal tongs&#8212;</span>It&#8217;s the easiest way to turn food on the grill or in the pan, and to transfer food to plates.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Microplane grater&#8212;</span>A kitchen must-have, this makes lightning quick work of citrus zest, ginger, garlic, and cheese. A little goes a long way, so you&#8217;ll be able to cut down on the amount of cheese you use without noticing.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Good-quality pans&#8212;</span>Use two or three saucepans with thick, sturdy bases, tall sides, stay-cool handles, and well-fitting lids. Make sure to have a large, heavy-based, nonstick saut&#233; pan that can be used for searing/flash-frying, and a casserole dish. Stainless steel looks stylish, wears well, and is easy to clean.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Omelet pan&#8212;</span>It&#8217;s perfect for quick meals for one or for toasting nuts. Buy nonstick and you won&#8217;t need oil.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Pastry brush&#8212;</span>It&#8217;s good for lightly oiling food before cooking.</p>
<a id="page53" />
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Pepper grinder</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Plastic containers&#8212;</span>You&#8217;ll need airtight ones for storing leftovers or for when you&#8217;re super-organized and make food in batches to freeze for future meals.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Nonstick roasting pan&#8212;</span>Buy one with a sturdy base.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Sharp knives&#8212;</span>Even just one super-sharp, high-quality knife is an investment you won&#8217;t regret.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Spatula&#8212;</span>It gets the food to where it needs to be.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Steamer&#8212;</span>This is an absolute kitchen essential. Some saucepans come with a steamer that fits on top or you can buy a universal steaming basket that fits into the pan.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Large wok with a lid&#8212;</span>If you care for your wok and season it after every use, you&#8217;ll hardly need any oil. Wok lids are useful when steaming veggies.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Wooden cutting board&#8212;</span>It lasts longer than plastic.</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">Wooden spoons&#8212;</span>Perfect for nonstick pans, combining ingredients, and is an all around great tool.</p>
