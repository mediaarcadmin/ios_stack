<p style=font-family:arial;font-size:40px;>7. Additional Restrictions.  Your use of the Service is also subject to the following restrictions:</p>
<p style=font-family:arial;font-size:40px;>7.1. Our Rules and Policies.</p>
<p style=font-family:arial;font-size:40px;>You agree to abide by all of the terms and conditions in these Terms of Service. These Terms of Service will be enforced in a nondiscriminatory manner to all end users of the Service, and may include, without limitation, required or automated updates, modifications and reinstallations of the Service Software, and obtaining available patches to, among other reasons, address security, interoperability, performance and/or other issues. These updates, modifications and the like may occur on a periodic or as needed basis without notice to you while your computer is connected to the Internet. In addition, you understand that the Service Software may be developed to be capable of monitoring itself and may create a unique system identification for your Registered PC and Registered Portable Device for security-related and tamper-detection purposes. Your copy of the Service Software and your access to certain applications that communicate with it, as applicable, are subject to restriction and/or revocation (such as being shut down) for security purposes or according to consistently applied content-protection policies. You understand and agree that this would likely result in Content that was previously available for use being unavailable thereafter.</p>
<p style=font-family:arial;font-size:40px;>7.2. Territory.</p>
<p style=font-family:arial;font-size:40px;>The Service is only available for use by users with a credit card with a United States or Canadian billing address (collectively, and as applicable, the "Territory"). You understand that if you are a Canadian resident, that you will only have access to Content available for distribution in Canada and that if you are a United States resident, that you will only have access to Content available for distribution in the United States. You understand and acknowledge that you may not sign up for, access, or attempt to access or use the Service from outside of the Territory applicable to you. By using or continuing to use the Service, you represent, covenant and agree that you comply with the applicable Territory requirements at all times while you maintain a Service Account.</p>
<p style=font-family:arial;font-size:40px;>7.3. Age Requirement.</p>
<p style=font-family:arial;font-size:40px;>You must be at least 18 years of age to agree to and accept these Terms of Service on your own behalf unless otherwise permitted by us. If you are under 18 years of age, but are at least 13 years of age or older, your parent or legal guardian must accept these Terms of Service and register for the Service on your behalf unless we permit otherwise. In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), as such may be amended from time to time, if you are under the age of 13, you are asked not to provide any information to us either through downloading any Service Software, using the Service, participating in or entering any promotions, contests or sweepstakes related to the Service, or through any other activity. If we have any knowledge that you are under 13 years of age and without express parental consent, any information you submit will not be retained by us, as described in our Privacy Policy. We believe that children using the Internet require special protection, and we urge parents or guardians to explain Internet safety to their children. Parents are urged to spend time online with their children to become familiar with the types of Content available on the Service and the Internet in general. Control tools are available from online services and software manufacturers to help create a safer environment for children.</p>

<p style=font-family:arial;font-size:40px;>7.5. Restriction on Use Related to the Service.</p>
<p style=font-family:arial;font-size:40px;>Because the Service includes security components, special rules and policies apply.
