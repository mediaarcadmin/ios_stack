Using VoiceOver in Blio</b></p>
<hr>
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">
If you do not already have a Blio.com account, you will need to create one in order to buy and download books.  Please visit Blio.com to create your account and shop.  Books you purchase are immediately ready for download and will appear in your Blio library after you log in.   They will always appear when using Blio thereafter, unless you delete them.  If you’d like to try Blio without an account, you can explore the sample books provided in your library.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">
To use Blio with VoiceOver, system 4.0 or higher is required, and system 5.0 or higher is recommended for best experience.  Three-finger swipe, continuous reading, and navigation by line all require system 5.0.</p>
