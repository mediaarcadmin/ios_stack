Using VoiceOver in Blio</b></p>
<hr>
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">
If you do not already have a Blio.com account, you will need to create one in order to buy and download books.  Please visit Blio.com to create your account and shop.  Books you purchase are immediately ready for download and will appear in your Blio library after you log in.   They will always appear when using Blio thereafter, unless you delete them.  Besides purchased books, you can also import books in PDF or ePub format, if they are not rights-protected.  If you’d like to try Blio without an account, you can explore the sample books provided in your library.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">
To use Blio with VoiceOver, system 4.0 or higher is required, and system 5.0 or higher is recommended for best experience.  Three-finger swipe, continuous reading, and navigation by line all require system 5.0.</p>

Getting Started</b></p>
<hr>
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">
If you are using Blio with VoiceOver, double tap the desired title and the book will open.  It will open to whatever page you were on when the book was last read, or to the cover if opened for the first time.  A series of controls will display in toolbars located near the top and the bottom of the screen.  VoiceOver will say “Library Back Button,” referring to the button in the top left-hand corner of the screen.  Note that this is VoiceOver’s default position, so double tapping the screen at this point will close the book and return you to the library.</p>  
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;"> 
To close the toolbars and begin reading a book with VoiceOver, touch anywhere in the center of the screen.  VoiceOver will say “Book Page.”  Double tap to get the full page to display, and VoiceOver will automatically begin reading the first paragraph on the page.</p>   
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">  
Use the two-finger swipe down gesture to have VoiceOver speak the entire page.  VoiceOver will read continuously until the end of the book unless you stop it by double tapping.  If you prefer that VoiceOver stop automatically at the end of each page, you can adjust the setting for Read Mode.  Touch near the bottom right of the screen until you hear "Reading Settings."  Select it, and flick right repeatedly until you hear "Read Mode."  Flick right twice more until you hear "By Page", then select.  You can change back at a later time by selecting "Continuous."</p>    
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">  
Double tap the center of the screen at any time to restore the controls.  VoiceOver will again say “Library Back Button.”  When the toolbars are open you can locate any desired control by first touching near the top or the bottom of the screen and then flicking right or left with one finger.  Double tap the screen to activate any control that is not disabled or dimmed.</p>  
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px; text-align:left;"><b>
Navigation</b></p>
<hr>
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">
Blio supports VoiceOver navigation by character, word, line, page, or chapter.</p> 
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">
To navigate by character, line, or word, select these options in your device's VoiceOver settings.  When a book is open and you've tapped the screen so that VoiceOver says "Book Page", bring up the VoiceOver rotor and choose the option you'd like.  A one-finger flick up or down will then move you forward or back by the chosen unit.</p> 
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">
To navigate by paragraph within a page, use a one-finger flick right or left to move forward or back.  Use a three-finger swipe right to advance to the next page, or left to go back a page.  VoiceOver will start reading the entire page automatically after each page transition.  To navigate by chapter, you can use the table of contents at any point in the book.  Double tap the center of the screen if necessary to display the controls.  Touch near the bottom of the screen, using a one finger flick right or left to locate the contents button.  Then double tap the screen to display the chapters.  Use a one finger flick right or left to navigate up and down through the table of contents.  When VoiceOver speaks the name or number of the desired chapter, double tap the screen to go there.  VoiceOver will say “Library Back Button.”  If you double tap, the full page will display and VoiceOver will begin reading it.</p>     
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">
To navigate to any page, use the Page Chooser.  When the book controls are displayed, touch the center of the screen to select the Book Page control.  Then use a one-finger flick once to the left to select the Page Chooser.  Use a one-finger flick up to advance to the next page, or down to move back a page.  For bigger page movements, double tap and hold the Page Chooser and move your finger left or right.  Lift your finger when you hear the page you’d like to go to.  This will move you to the page.  To read the page, touch the center of the screen to select the Book Page control, then double tap to close the toolbars.</p>  
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px; text-align:left;"><b>
Text Search</b></p>
<hr>
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">
To search for specific text within an opened book, double tap the “Search” button located just above the physical home button on your iOS device. When the virtual keyboard displays, type in the text you want to search for.  Double tap the “Search” button located in the bottom right corner of the virtual keyboard. When the search is complete, VoiceOver will announce the number of match results.  Double tap a match result to navigate to the page where the text has been found.  Double tap the center of the screen to read the page.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px; text-align:left;"><b>
Reading With a Text-To-Speech Voice</b></p>
<hr>
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">
Besides reading books with VoiceOver, Blio supports reading with high quality text-to-speech voices.  Each voice requires at least 15 megabytes of free space and may be used independently of VoiceOver.</p>  
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">
To purchase a voice, take the following steps.  You should first create an iTunes account if you don’t already have one.</p> 
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">
1. Go to your Blio library and double tap the "Application Settings" button located in the bottom right corner of the screen.</p> 
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">
2. Double tap the "Voice" button, which is the first item under the "Settings" heading.</p> 
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">
3. Double tap the "Download Voices" button to obtain a list of available voices.  To hear a sample of any voice, double tap the "Play Sample" button located after the name of each voice.</p> 
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">
4. To purchase a voice, double tap the associated price located after the name of the desired voice and confirm the purchase.</p> 
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">
5. To complete the process, enter the password for your iTunes account.  The download should begin automatically.</p> 
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">
Once a voice has been purchased, you can adjust its speed or volume by navigating to "Voices" under "Application Settings.”  Double tap the name of the voice.  Use a one-finger flick right, four times, to navigate to the Speed control.   Swipe up to increase the speed at which the voice reads, and swipe down to decrease it.  Flick right twice to navigate to the Volume control.  Swipe up to increase the volume at which the voice reads, and swipe down to decrease it.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:40px;">
Now you can use the voice to read books!  A book may not come with permission for reading by a text-to-speech voice.  To read a book that does, double tap the play button found in the toolbar near the bottom of the screen when the book is open.  To pause the reading at any point, double tap the center of the screen.</p>
