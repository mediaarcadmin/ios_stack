      <Run Tag="__88">uring the 2006 season right fielder Brad Hawpe of the Colorado Rockies had a basic Runs Created rating of 5.04 runs per game. During the 2006 season San Diego Padre second baseman Josh Barfield had a basic Runs Created rating of 4.21 runs per game. On the surface, this would seem to indicate that Hawpe had a much better hitting season than did Barfield. Most baseball fans, however, realize that the Rockies play in Coors Field, which is notorious for being a hitter&#x2019;s park because the air is thin (the ball carries farther) and the park is not that big. On the other hand, the Padres play in spacious Petco Park, and the Padres are routinely involved in low-scoring games. Does the fact that Hawpe played in a hitter&#x2019;s park and Barfield in a pitcher&#x2019;s park mean that Barfield actually had a better hitting season than did Hawpe? As we will soon see, Barfield and Hawpe had virtually identical hitting seasons.</Run>

      <Run Tag="__88">Bill James was the first to develop the concept of Park Factors. In every NBA arena the court is the same size and the baskets are ten feet high. In every NFL stadium the fields are the same dimensions (although Denver&#x2019;s thin air, domed stadiums and inclement weather may affect performance). In baseball, however, each stadium has different dimensions, which certainly influences how many runs are scored in the park. Park Factors are an attempt to measure how the park influences runs scored, home runs hit, and so forth.</Run>

      <Run Tag="__89">Of course, we can adjust a pitcher&#x2019;s DIPS forecast for ERA to account for his Park Factor. For example, we should raise a San Diego Padre pitcher&#x2019;s DIPS by 1/.93, or around 8%. Recognizing that around 10 runs = 1 win = 2,000 SAGWINDIFF points, we can then adjust a hitter or pitcher&#x2019;s SAGWINDIFF rating based on his Park Factor. For example, the park adjustment indicates that Barfield actually created 0.32 more runs per game than indicated by his basic Runs Created rating. Barfield caused 14.37 games&#x2019; worth of outs, so he really created (14.37) &#xD7; .32 = 4.60 more runs that our basic rating indicates. This is worth 0.460 wins, or 920 points. Barfield&#x2019;s initial Player Win Rating was &#x2013;606 points. Therefore, we should add 920 points to Barfield&#x2019;s 2006 Player Win Rating, leading to a final rating of &#x2013;606 + 920 = 314 points.</Run>
