      <Run Tag="__212"> we described the methodology for creating Adjusted + / &#x2013; ratings. These are helpful to teams in making decisions involving players such as trades and salaries. During the season, however, few players are traded and a team&#x2019;s major concern is how to win more games with their current roster. The most important decisions coaches make during the season are which lineups to play when. For example, should a team try to go small against the 2006&#x2013;7 Suns&#x2019; &#x201C;small ball,&#x201D; or should they go big and push the ball inside?</Run>

      <Run Tag="xhtml/part03chapter31.html#page_225">Once we have player ratings it is easy to develop lineup ratings. Suppose we want to rate the Indiana Pacers&#x2019; lineup of Jermaine O&#x2019;Neal, Danny Granger, Jamaal Tinsley, Troy Murphy, and Mike Dunleavy. Let&#x2019;s call this lineup Pacers 1A. During the 2006&#x2013;7 season this lineup played 326 minutes (more than any other Pacer lineup). They outscored their opponents by 11 points. This means that Pacers 1A played 326/48 = 6.79 games and has a Pure + / &#x2013; of 11/6.79 = 1.61 points per 48 minutes. Then we look at each minute Pacer 1A was on the court and average the total abilities of the opponents (adjusting, of course, for the league home edge of 3.2 points). We find this lineup played against opposition lineups averaging in ability 1.89 points better than league average. This means that Pacers&#x2019; 1A should have an Adjusted + / &#x2013; rating of 1.61 + 1.89 = 3.5 points. In short, this means that Pacers 1A would beat an average NBA lineup (a lineup where the sum of the five player ratings is 0) by 3.5 points per 48 minutes. The amazing thing is that many teams play inferior lineups many more minutes than they do their better lineups. For example, in 2006&#x2013;7 the Charlotte Hornets played the lineup of Raymond Felton, Emeka Okafor, Adam Morrison, Brevin Knight, and Gerald Wallace 167 minutes at a &#x2013; 5 level and lost by 44 points to their opponents. This is not a good performance, yet this was the lineup used the most by Charlotte during the season. Substituting Matt Carroll for Brevin Knight in this lineup yields a lineup that played 144 minutes at a + 20 level and beat its opponents by 58 points. Why not play the second lineup more often?</Run>

      <Run Tag="__212">The Cleveland Cavaliers played Drew Gooden, Larry Hughes, LeBron James, Eric Snow, and Anderson Varejo 156 minutes during the 2006&#x2013;7 season. This lineup played at a &#x2013; 14 level and was beaten soundly by 56 points. The lineup resulting from simply substituting Sasha Pavlovic for Eric Snow played 124 minutes and played at a + 25 level and outscored the Cavs&#x2019; opponents by 58 points.

      <Run Tag="__213">Critics might say that lineups do not play many minutes, so there must be a lot of variability in the lineup ratings. What is the probability that a given lineup is really better than another lineup? The spreadsheet Lineupssuperiority.xls answers this question. Enter the minutes played and lineup rating for the better lineup in row 4 and the same data for the inferior lineup in row 5. Cell E8 indicates the chance that the lineup with the higher rating is truly better. There is over a 99% chance that the Cavs&#x2019; lineup with Pavlovic is actually superior to the lineup with Snow. This should convince the Cavs that the inferior lineup should play little, if at all.</Run>

When a lineup plays poorly coaches say these guys play &#x201C;like they have never seen each other before.&#x201D; We can easily identify lineups with good or bad chemistry. We define the lineup&#x2019;s chemistry value as (lineup rating) &#x2013; (sum of individual player ratings).

For example, Chauncey Billups, Rick Hamilton, Jason Maxiell, Tayshaun Prince, and Chris Webber played 25.6 points better per 48 minutes than expected, while Pau Gasol, Eddie Jones, Mike Miller, Lawrence Roberts, and Damon Stoudamire played 20.1 points worse than expected. It would be helpful to discover what factors lead to positive and negative chemistry. For example, if a lineup has too many scorers and not enough effective defensive players, does that tend to lead to negative lineup chemistry?</Run>
