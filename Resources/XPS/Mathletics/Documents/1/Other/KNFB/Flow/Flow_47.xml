    <Paragraph TextIndent="16" Margin="0,0,0,0" TextAlignment="Justify" FontFamily="times new roman" FontSize="14">
      <Run Tag="__233">Lawhorn begins by looking at actual data. He assumes that the current possession will be the last possession during regulation. He finds that with less than 11 seconds left, teams that trailed by three points hit 41 out of 205 three-pointers. This means that if the team with the ball is allowed to shoot, they have a 20% chance of tying the game and therefore a 10% chance of winning the game (assuming each team has the same chance to win in overtime). If the defensive team fouls the trailing team, Lawhorn assumes that the only way the trailing team can tie is to make the first free throw and then miss the second free throw intentionally. Then Lawhorn assumes the trailing team must either tip the ball in or kick the ball out and hit a two-pointer to tie the game. Lawhorn calculates that the trailing team has roughly a 5% chance of tying the game or around a 2.5% chance of winning the game. Lawhorn does not consider the ultimate coach&#x2019;s nightmare: the trailing team hits the first free throw and after rebounding an intentionally missed second shot hits a three-pointer to win. NBA teams hit around 75% of their free throws and rebound around 14% of missed free throws. Suppose the trailing team can hit 30% of their three-pointers. If the trailing team elects to take a three-pointer after rebounding a missed three-pointer, then the probability that they will win is .75(.14)(.3) = .03, or 3%. This is slightly better than the 2.5% chance of winning if they attempt a two-pointer. Therefore, fouling the trailing team reduces their chances of winning from 10% to 3% and seems like a good idea. Annis comes to a similar conclusion. The key assumption made by Lawhorn and Annis is, of course, that the game ends after the current possession. In reality, if the defensive team fouls the trailing team after their free throws, they in turn will foul the defensive team and probably get the ball back. If the trailing team makes both free throws and the defensive team misses one out of two free throws, then the trailing team can win the game with a three-pointer or tie with a two-pointer! The problem is that we cannot know whether the current possession is the last possession. Lawhorn found 32 games in which a team trailed by three points with less than 11 seconds left and the leading team intentionally fouled the trailing team. In seven of these games (21.9%), the trailing team tied the game. Although this is a small sample, the data indicate that when multiple possessions are a possibility, fouling may not be the correct strategy.</Run>
