      <Run Tag="__127">FL teams want to win games. Is it more important to have a good rushing attack or a good passing attack? Is rushing defense more important than passing defense? Is it true that turnovers kill you? During the early 1960s statistician Bud Goode studied what makes a team win. He found that passing yards per attempt (PY/A) on both offense and defense were the most important factors in predicting an NFL team&#x2019;s success. This is intuitively satisfying because PY/A is more of a measure of efficiency than total yards passing. Since we divide by pass attempts, PY/A recognizes that passing plays use up a scarce resource (a down).</Run>

      <Run Tag="__128">The coefficients for offensive and defensive passing efficiency are almost triple the coefficients for offensive and defensive rushing efficiency. This is consistent with Goode&#x2019;s finding that passing efficiency is the key driver of success in the NFL. The standard deviation of team PY/A is 0.83 yards and the standard deviation of RY/A is 0.55 yards. This means that if an average passing team were to move to the 84th percentile in PY/A (one standard deviation above average) their performance would improve by 0.83 &#xD7; 61.67 = 52 points; if an average rushing team were to move up to the 84th percentile in RY/A, their performance would improve by 0.5 (26.44) = 13.22 points. If it costs the same (in terms of percentile ranking) to improve passing and rushing offense, a team is better off trying to improve its passing offense. Our results give little credence to the belief of so-called experts that you need a good ground game to set up your passing game. In fact the correlation between PY/A and RY/A is only 0.10.</Run>

If we drop this independent variable from our model we find that a defensive turnover is worth 3.7 points and an offensive turnover costs 3.4 points.

For example, if an all-pro receiver costs $10 million and an all-pro linebacker costs $10 million, which expenditure will improve team performance more? This is difficult to answer. The linebacker will have a big impact on DTO, DRY/A, and DPY/A, while the receiver will probably only effect PY/A and TO.
