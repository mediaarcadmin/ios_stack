These metrics were primarily developed to &#x201C;fit&#x201D; the relationship between runs scored by a team during a season and team statistics such as walks, singles, doubles, triples, and home runs.

Or we could draw from a deck of cards and assign a red card to an out and a black card to a home run. Both the coin toss and the card-drawing method will assign a 0.5 chance to a home run and a 0.5 chance to an out. We keep flipping the coin or drawing a card (with replacement) until we obtain 3 outs. Then we record the number of home runs. We repeat this procedure about 1,000 times and average the number of runs scored per inning. This average should closely approximate the average runs per inning scored by our hypothetical player. We will get very close to 3,000 total runs, which yields an estimate of 3 runs per inning. I implemented the simple Monte Carlo simulation using Microsoft Excel. (See </Run>

The RAND() function yields any number between 0 and 1 with equal probability. This means, for example, that half the time RAND() yields a number between 0 and 0.5, and half the time RAND() yields a number between 0.5 and 1. The results generated by the RAND() function are called random numbers. Therefore, we can simulate an inning for our player by assigning an outcome of a home run to a random number less than or equal to 0.5 and assigning an outcome of an out to a random number between 0.5 and 1.

Playing out thousands of innings with @RISK enables us to estimate the average number of runs scored per inning by a team of nine Ichiros. Then we multiply the average number of innings a team bats during a game (26.72/3) to estimate the number of Runs Created per game by Ichiro. Since we are playing out each inning using the actual probabilities corresponding to a given player, our Monte Carlo estimate of the runs per inning produced by nine Ichiros (or nine of any other player) should be a far better estimate than Runs Created or Linear Weights.
