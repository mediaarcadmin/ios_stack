Therefore, the probability that a pitcher with 35 starts will pitch consecutive no-hitters during a season is approximately 34 &#xD7; (.000000038) = .0000128. Our computations assume that if a pitcher throws two consecutive no-hitters, he has thrown no prior no-hitters during the season. We performed a Monte Carlo simulation to confirm that this assumption has little effect on the end result of our probability calculations.</Run>

      <Run Tag="__124">Another way to demonstrate how rare consecutive no-hitters are is to determine how many years (with 35 starts per year) the greatest no-hit pitcher of all time (Nolan Ryan) would have to pitch before he had a 50% chance of throwing consecutive no-hitters. Ryan pitched 6 no-hitters in 773 starts, so the chance that any of his starts would result in a no-hitter is 6/773 = .00776. This yields a .0018 chance of consecutive no-hitters during a season. Ryan would have needed to pitch 384 seasons to have a 50% chance of throwing consecutive no-hitters.</Run>

      <Run Tag="__124">We close this chapter with a brainteaser. A starting pitcher pitches a complete game and the game is nine innings. What is the minimum number of pitches the starting pitcher could have thrown? The answer is 25. The starting pitcher is pitching for the visiting team and allows only one runner to reach base (on a home run) and loses 1&#x2013;0. The starting pitcher does not need to pitch the ninth inning, so he throws 8 &#xD7; 3 + 1 = 25 pitches.</Run>
