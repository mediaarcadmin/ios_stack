      <Run Tag="__9"> would like to acknowledge George Nemhauser of Georgia Tech, Michael Magazine of the University of Cincinnati, and an anonymous reviewer for their extremely helpful suggestions. Most of all, I would like to recognize my best friend and sports handicapper, Jeff Sagarin. My discussions with Jeff about sports and mathematics have always been stimulating, and this book would not be one-tenth as good if I did not know Jeff.</Run>

      <Run Tag="__9">All the math you need to know will be developed as you proceed through the book. When you have completed the book, you should be capable of doing your own mathletics research using the vast amount of data readily available on the Internet. Even if your career does not involve sports, I hope working through the logical analyses described in this book will help you think more logically and analytically about the decisions you make in your own career. I also hope you will watch sporting events with a more analytical perspective. If you enjoy reading this book as much as I enjoyed writing it, you will have a great time. My contact information is given below. I look forward to hearing from you.</Run>
