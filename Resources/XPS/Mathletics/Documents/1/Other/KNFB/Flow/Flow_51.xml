      <Run Tag="__246">ost gamblers believe that when bookies set point spreads their goal is to have half the money bet on each team. If I bet $10, for example, on a 7.5-point favorite to cover the spread, I win $10 if the team covers but I lose $11 if the favorite does not cover. If the favorite covers the points spread half the time, on average each $10 bet results in an expected profit of (1/2)($10) + (1/2)(&#x2013;$11) = $&#x2013; .50. Thus a bettor loses on average $0.50/$10.50 or $1/21 per dollar bet. Assuming we bet the same amount on each game, to break even we would have to win a fraction p of our bets where p(10) + (1 &#x2013; p)(&#x2013;11) = 0. The value p = 11/21 = .524 solves this equation. Thus to win money on average we must beat the point spread at least 52.4% of the time.</Run>

For example, if the Colts have a power rating of + 10 and the Browns have a power rating of &#x2013; 4, we would expect on a neutral field the Colts to win by 10 &#x2013; (&#x2013;4) = 14 points. Of course, teams play better at home. Home edges for various sports (based on the last ten years) are 3 points for the NFL, NBA, and college football and 4 points for NCAA men&#x2019;s basketball. We will see later in the chapter how to estimate the home edge for a given set of games. Using the NFL home edge of 3 points the bookies would favor the Colts by 14 + 3 = 17 points at home and favor the Colts by 14 &#x2013; 3 = 11 points at Cleveland. Predictions created from power ratings usually create (in the absence of injuries) a &#x201C;fair line&#x201D; in the sense that the favorite and underdog have an equal chance of covering the prediction.</Run>

The Super Bowl Champion Colts are sixth best. The reason the Colts do not show up that well is that minimizing the sum of squared errors gives a lot of weight to outliers or atypical games. This is because squaring errors magnifies the effects of huge errors on our objective or Target Cell. For example, Jacksonville beat Indianapolis 44&#x2013;17 at home during 2006. This rout makes it difficult for the computer to rate the Colts ahead of Jacksonville. If we delete this game and rerun our model we find the Colts are now rated at 8.83 and Jaguars at 6.03. Thus this one game resulted in a three-point swing in our estimate of the relative merits of these teams.</Run>

      <Run Tag="xhtml/part04chapter40.html#page_280"> shows that Brazil had the best offense and Switzerland the best defense. The predicted number of goals scored by a team in a game is (mean) &#xD7; (team offense rating) &#xD7; (team defense rating). For example, when Germany plays Costa Rica we expect Germany to score 1.35 &#xD7; (2.05) &#xD7; (1.56) = 4.32 goals. (The mean was a changing cell in Solver as well as in each team&#x2019;s offense and defense rating.) We found that an average offensive team scored 1.35 goals per game. We did not use additive offense and defense ratings as we did in American football, because this might lead us to predict a negative number of goals scored in a game.</Run>
