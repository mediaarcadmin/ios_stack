The Phillies had five games remaining with the Reds and three with the Cardinals. The Cardinals and Reds did not have to play each other. Again we used Monte Carlo simulation to play out the rest of the season. Since all three teams had each won around 57% of their games through September 20, we assumed they all had a .57 chance of winning any non-head-to-head game. We assumed each team also had an equal chance of winning a head-to-head game. In case of a two-way tie we assumed each team had a .5 chance of winning the pennant, and in case of a three-way tie we assumed each team had a 1 in 3 chance of winning the pennant. After using Monte Carlo simulation to play out the remainder of the season 40,000 times, we found that the Phillies had a 1.8% chance of not winning the pennant. This probability may seem higher than expected, but note that the Phillies had a much harder schedule than the Reds or Cardinals.</Run>
