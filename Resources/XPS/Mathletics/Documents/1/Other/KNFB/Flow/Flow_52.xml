      <Run Tag="__265">ports fans love the NFL because it seems like there is always a surprise team that wins the Super Bowl or challenges for the championship. For example, who expected Tampa Bay to win the Super Bowl in 2002? NBA fans complain the same teams (such as Detroit and San Antonio) are always on top. It is easy to show that the NFL does indeed exhibit more parity and unexpected team performance than does the NBA.</Run>

      <Run Tag="xhtml/part04chapter41.html#rfnpage_283">If a league has a great deal of parity you would expect it to be difficult to predict a team&#x2019;s performance based on their previous year&#x2019;s performance. That is, teams that do poorly one season should have a good shot at being above average the following season, and vice versa. If a league exhibits little parity you would expect that it would be relatively easy to predict a team&#x2019;s performance for one season using the previous year&#x2019;s performance. What metric should we use to measure team performance? The simplest metric would be regular season wins, but we have seen that NFL teams play schedules that differ by 7 or more points in difficulty. A team with a tough schedule and 9&#x2013;7 record might be much better than a team that went 11-5 with an easy schedule. We will use the final Sagarin rating as our metric for team performance during a season.</Run>

The file Parity.xls contains the ratings for each NFL team and NBA team for five seasons (for the NBA, 2002&#x2013;3 through 2006&#x2013;7 seasons and for the NFL, the 2002&#x2013;6 seasons). We try to predict each team&#x2019;s Sagarin rating during a year based on their previous year&#x2019;s Sagarin rating. For example, for our NBA data we would have the following four data points for the Spurs: (Spurs 2002&#x2013;3 rating, </Run>

We simply find the best-fitting line to predict the following season&#x2019;s rating based on the previous season&#x2019;s rating. Sagarin ratings average to 20 in the NFL and 90 in the NBA.</Run>

We find that the following year&#x2019;s NFL team performance has a .35 correlation with the team&#x2019;s performance the previous year, while the following year&#x2019;s NBA team performance has a .56 correlation with the team&#x2019;s performance the previous year. This shows that it is much easier to predict an NBA team&#x2019;s performance than an NFL team&#x2019;s performance using the previous year&#x2019;s data. This means that good NBA teams are much more likely to stay good than are good NFL teams. Conversely, bad NFL teams have a much better shot at being good the following year than do bad NBA teams. This insight is consistent with the prevalent view that the NFL has more parity than the NBA. Looking at the least squares lines shown in </Run>

Similarly, an NBA team that is 10 points worse than average would be predicted to play 5.51 points worse than average the following year and an NFL team that played 10 points worse than average would be expected to play only 3.61 points worse than average the following year. Thus for each league we predict a team to play closer to average the following year than they did the previous year. This is an example of regression toward the mean. NFL teams regress more to the mean than do NBA teams. The fact that a good NFL team on average ends up closer to average the following season than does a good NBA team must mean that more good NFL teams play poorly the following season (and more bad NFL teams play well).</Run>

      <Run Tag="__267">Why does the NFL exhibit more parity than the NBA? The NFL has a &#x201C;hard&#x201D; salary cap ($109 million per team in 2007), which teams cannot exceed. The NBA penalizes teams that exceed the salary cap ($55.6 million in 2007), but teams are allowed to exceed the salary cap. If an NFL team performs well then their star players may seek higher salaries elsewhere because the hard cap prevents a great team from rewarding all their good players.</Run>

      <Run Tag="__267">In addition, in the NFL draft the worst team is guaranteed the first draft pick. In the NBA a lottery is held and the worst team has only a 25% chance of getting the first pick. In short, the NFL draft has teams draft in inverse order of team performance while the NBA only approximates teams drafting in inverse order of performance. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that the NFL draft would create more parity than would the NBA draft.</Run>

      <Run Tag="xhtml/part04chapter41.html#page_286">The NBA and the NFL also differ in terms of the way player contracts are handled. In the NFL no contract is guaranteed. A player can have a six-year, $100 million contract and if the team cuts the player then the team does not have to pay the player. In the NBA, however, most player contracts are structured so that if a team cuts a player the team still owes the player his money. This dichotomy makes it much easier to change an NFL roster than change an NBA roster. Since it is harder to change an NBA team roster, we would expect that NBA teams&#x2019; performance during the following season would be more similar to their performance the previous season than would be the case with the performance of an NFL team.</Run>
