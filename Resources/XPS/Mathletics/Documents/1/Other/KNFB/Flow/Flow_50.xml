      <Run Tag="xhtml/part04chapter39.html#page_263"> fame showed that bookmakers can exploit bettor biases to make an expected profit exceeding 4.5% per dollar bet. Levitt obtained bettor records for 20,000 bettors during the 2001 NFL season. He found that much more than 50% of all money is bet on favorites and less than 50% on underdogs. When the home team was favored, 56.1% of the bets were on the favorite and 43.9% of the bets were on the underdog. When the visiting team was favored, 68.2% of the bets were on the favorite and 31.8% of the bets were on the underdog. These results are inconsistent with the widely held belief that bookmakers set spreads in an attempt to balance the amount of money bet on the underdog and favorite. We will see that if more money is bet on favorites, and favorites cover the spread less than half the time, then bookmakers can earn an expected profit exceeding 4.5%. For Levitt&#x2019;s sample, this does turn out to be the case. In Levitt&#x2019;s sample, bets on home favorites win 49.1% of time. Bets on home underdogs win 57.7% of time. Levitt found that bets on visiting favorites win 47.8% of time, while bets on road underdogs win 50.4% of time. Thus favorites are not a good bet. These data indicate that the line on favorites is inflated to take advantage of the bias of bettors toward favorites. For example, when setting the line for Super Bowl XLI the bookmaker may have thought the Colts were only 6 points better than the Bears. Since bettors are biased toward the favorite, the bookmaker might set the line at Colts &#x2013;7. Since the true situation is that the Colts are 6 points better than the Bears, a bet on Colts &#x2013;7 has less than a 50% chance of winning. Because bettors are biased toward favorites, in all likelihood lots of money will still come in on the Colts. Since the true point spread should be 6, the Colts have less than a 50% chance of covering the 7-point spread. This means that on average the bookies will do better than the sure profit rate of 4.5% that they would be guaranteed if an equal amount of money were bet on each side of the line.</Run>

      <Run Tag="__242">So how does the bookmaker do in Levitt&#x2019;s sample? We find that the bettors win 49.45% of their bets and lose 50.55% of their bets. Thus on average the bookmaker earns .4945(&#x2013;10)+.5055(11)=61.56 cents per $10 bet. If bettors win half their bets, then bookmakers make on average .5(&#x2013;10)+.5(11)=50 cents per $10 bet. Thus the bookies&#x2019; apparent slight edge (49.45% vs. 50% wins) in winning bets translates to a 61.56/50=23% increase in mean profits.</Run>

      <Run Tag="__242">Levitt checked to see whether the surprising failure of favorites to cover the spread had occurred during previous seasons. During 1980&#x2013;2001, 48.8% of home favorites and 46.7% of visiting favorites covered the spread. This means that a bettor could have made money by simply betting on home underdogs. Levitt also found that the tendency of the favorite to fail to cover the spread was virtually independent of the size of the spread. During 1980&#x2013;2001, 48.5% of teams favored by more than 6 points covered, 48.1% of teams favored by 3.5&#x2013;6 points covered, and 47.8% of teams favored by less than 3 points covered the spread.</Run>

Thus a bet on the &#x201C;over&#x201D; against the Total Line when Clark officiated would have won 58.8% of the time. Is this statistically significant?

This means that if the Total Line is fair, covering the Total Line 221 times or more is equivalent to seeing an observation from a normal random variable that is 3.4 standard deviations above average. Putting this in perspective, this is about as rare as seeing a randomly chosen person whose IQ exceeds 100+3.4(15)=151 (IQs have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15).</Run>

      <Run Tag="__244">These data seem to indicate that certain officials can influence the total points scored in a game. Can we make money exploiting the fact that the Total Line does not appear to adjust for this fact? Let&#x2019;s try the following simple system. For the 2006&#x2013;7 season we will predict the probability that the over bet will win in a given game by averaging the fraction of the time (for the 2003&#x2013;4, 2004&#x2013;5, and 2005&#x2013;6 seasons) that the over bet covered for each game official. For example, referees 1, 2, and 3 are officiating a game. When referee 1 officiated the over bet covered 45% of the time, when referee 2 officiated the over bet won 47% of the time, and when referee 3 officiated the over bet covered 49% of the time. Averaging these three percentages yields an estimate that the over bet will win 49% of the time. Let&#x2019;s assume that when our prediction exceeds 53% we will bet the over on the Total Line, and when our prediction is under 47% we will bet the under on the Total Line. During the 2006&#x2013;7 seasons this strategy won 97 of 185 (or 52.4%) of all bets on the Total Line. Thus, assuming that a referee&#x2019;s past tendencies on the Total Line will continue allows us to win more than half of our bets but not to make money.</Run>
