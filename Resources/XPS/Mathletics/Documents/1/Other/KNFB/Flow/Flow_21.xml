Such an average does not often lead to a Hall of Fame selection, but in 2000 Perez was elected to the Hall of Fame while some of his contemporaries who have similar statistics (such as Andre Dawson and Dave Parker) have not yet been elected. One reason Perez made it to the Hall of Fame was that his manager, Sparky Anderson, said that Perez was the best clutch hitter he had ever seen. Is there an objective way to determine whether Perez was a great &#x201C;clutch hitter&#x201D;?</Run>

Then Adler compared the batter&#x2019;s OBP in these situations to his overall season OBP. If the batter did significantly better during the clutch situations, then we could say the batter exhibited clutch hitting ability. The problem with this approach is that the average batter only encounters ten clutch situations per season, which does not provide enough data to reliably estimate a hitter&#x2019;s clutch ability.</Run>
