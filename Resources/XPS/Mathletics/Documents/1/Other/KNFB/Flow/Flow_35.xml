      <Run Tag="xhtml/part02chapter26.html#rfnpage_175">hen an NFL game goes into overtime a coin toss takes place and the team that wins the coin toss has the choice of kicking off or receiving. Since the overtime is sudden death, the team winning the coin toss invariably chooses to receive so they have the first chance to score and win the game. During the 1994&#x2013;2006 seasons the team that received the kickoff in overtime won 60% of the games. It seems unfair that in NFL overtime the team winning the coin flip should have such a huge edge. In attempt to lessen the impact of the coin flip result on the game&#x2019;s outcome, the NFL recently proposed moving the kickoff from the 30-to the 35-yard line. This would give the team receiving the kickoff slightly worse field position and theoretically would decrease the chance that the team receiving the kickoff would score on the first possession. This should give the team kicking off a better chance to win the game. As we will see, a simple mathematical analysis (our model is a simplified version of Jones&#x2019;s model)</Run>

Assuming that each team has a probability p of scoring on each possession, what is the probability that the team receiving the kickoff will win the game? During the regular NFL season, overtime games last only one quarter. If no team scores during the first overtime session, the game is a tie. This happens less than 5% of the time. Our analysis is greatly simplified if we assume that the overtime can theoretically continue forever. Since less than 5% of NFL games fail to yield a winner during the overtime, our assumption differs from reality in, at most, 5% of all games, so our assumption should not cause our calculations to differ too much from reality. Let K = probability that the team receiving the kickoff in overtime wins the game. There are two ways the receiving team can win:</Run>

If they fail to score and later lose the game, they have only themselves to blame. This approach allows teams to bid based on their strengths and weaknesses. A good offensive team like the Colts is probably confident they can drive to field goal range and will bid close to their own goal line to ensure possession. A good defensive team will probably be happy to let the other team start with ball deep in their own territory. If there is a tie on the first bid then the teams each submit another bid.</Run>

For example, if I choose the 50-yard line, my opponent will surely choose the ball. If I choose my 10-yard line, the opponent will probably let me start from my 10-yard line. Assume that I am allowed to choose the yard line on which the first possession starts. Assuming the two teams are of equal ability, I would pick the yard line x for which I feel I have a 50% chance of winning the game if I start with the ball on yard line x. If the other side gives me the ball, I have a 50% chance of winning. Assume the teams are equal. Then the other team also has a 50% chance of winning if they have the ball first and start on yard line x. Thus my choice guarantees me a 50% chance of victory. If my opponent chooses yard line x, then I choose to start with the ball if I believe my chance of winning from yard line x is at least .5, and I choose to give the other team the ball if I believe that my chance of winning from yard line x is less than 0.5. Assuming the two teams are of equal ability, then this choice again ensures that I have at least a 50% chance of winning. Therefore, this solution ensures that whether or not a team wins a coin flip, they have a 50% chance of winning. Of course, our argument shows that if we win the coin flip, then we should let the opponent choose the yard line. Then our chance of winning might exceed 50%.</Run>
