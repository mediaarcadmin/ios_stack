The NCAA selection committee wants an accurate view of the teams&#x2019; relative abilities, but, like the BCS selection committee, the NCAA tournament selection committee wants to use only a team&#x2019;s win-loss record and not the score of their games to rank teams. The NCAA believes that including game scores in the ranking and seeding process would cause the top teams to try and run up the score on lesser opponents. In </Run>

This gave teams like Duke, which played many more home games than road games, an unfair advantage in the RPI rankings. Beginning with the 2005 season, a home win or road loss was counted as 0.6 wins or 0.6 losses. An away win or home loss was counted at 1.4 wins or losses. This correction negates the advantage that a team used to receive by dint of playing extra home games.</Run>

This counterintuitive property of the RPI is its fatal flaw and should cause the NCAA to throw the baby out with the bath water and replace the RPI with a logistic regression-based rating system. Before detailing the RPI&#x2019;s flaw let&#x2019;s work through a simple example of how the RPI is calculated. For simplicity we will assume that all games are played on a neutral court, so the 1.4 and .6 corrections previously mentioned are not relevant.

After removing Purdue&#x2019;s results, Purdue&#x2019;s opponents were 1&#x2013;0 (IU) and 2&#x2013;0 (other unnamed opponent). Therefore, the average winning percentage of Purdue&#x2019;s opponents is .5(1 + 1) = 1. Iowa&#x2019;s three opponents have (excluding their game against Iowa) winning percentages of 1&#x2013;0 (IU), 0&#x2013;2, and 2&#x2013;0. The average win-loss percentage of Iowa&#x2019;s opponents is then 1/3(1 + 0 + 1) = 2/3. Therefore, IU&#x2019;s OPPOPP = .5(1 + (2/3)) = .833.
