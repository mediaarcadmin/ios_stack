      <Run Tag="__71">urprisingly, until the late 1990s little progress was made in determining how to evaluate the effectiveness of fielders and the relative importance of fielding (as compared to batting and hitting). Until recently the prevailing wisdom in baseball was that you had to have &#x201C;strength up the middle&#x201D; (good fielding at second base, shortstop, catcher, and center field) to have a good team. We will see that in most cases, the differences in player fielding abilities are not significant enough to be a major factor in team per formance. As the saying goes, the exception proves the rule and we will see that the 2005 Yankees were a very poor fielding team, and we can estimate that their poor fielding cost them approximately eleven wins.</Run>

During 2002&#x2013;6 Jeter&#x2019;s fielding percentage was below average only during 2003 (he was injured during much of the 2003 season). In contrast, Furcal had an above-average fielding percentage only during 2005. So this superficial analysis indicates that Jeter is a much better shortstop than Furcal. Not so fast! The problem with Fielding Percentage is that it does not take into account the balls a player does not get to; a player cannot make an error on a ball he does not get to. If a SS does not move, he will field easy balls and make few errors. An immobile shortstop will allow many more base hits than a shortstop with great range.</Run>

      <Run Tag="__73">How can we measure whether a shortstop has great range or poor range? Bill James developed an ingenious yet simple measure of fielding effectiveness, which he calls the Range Factor (RF). James defines a fielder&#x2019;s RF as the sum of putouts and assists a fielder gets per game played. Then James normalizes this statistic relative to all players in a given position. It turns out that shortstops during 2000&#x2013;2006 average 4.483 PO + A per game. Thus a SS who had 5 PO + A per game would have an RF of 5/4.48 = 1.11. This SS fields 11% more balls than a typical SS. Shortstops with an RF larger than 1 have above-average range and shortstops with range factors less than 1 have below-average range. Let&#x2019;s compute Derek Jeter&#x2019;s 2006 RF. We assume 8.9 innings per game. The column InnOuts indicates that in 2006 Jeter was the on field for 3,877/(8.9 &#xD7; 3) = 145.2 games. Jeter had PO + A 214 + 381 = 595. Thus Jeter successfully handled </Run>

      <Run Tag="__73"> This implies that in 2006 Jeter successfully handled 9% fewer chances than an average SS. In contrast, Furcal in 2006 handled 10% more chances than an average SS. For the sake of comparison, Ozzie Smith (who played shortstop for the Padres and Cardinals from 1978 to 1996) is generally considered the greatest fielding shortstop of all time. Ozzie had a lifetime fielding average of .978 (slightly above average), but he had several years where his RF exceeded 1.3. For Ozzie Smith, the Range Factor metric shows his true greatness.</Run>

Dewan and his colleagues at Baseball Info Solutions watch videotape of every MLB play and determine how hard each ball was hit and which &#x201C;zone&#x201D; of the field the ball was hit to. Then they determine the chance (based on all plays during a season) that a ball hit at a par tic u lar speed to a zone would be successfully fielded. For example, they might find that 20% of all balls hit softly over second base are successfully fielded by shortstops. A shortstop who successfully fields such a ball has prevented one hit. An average fielder would have successfully fielded this ball 20% of the time, so our SS has prevented 1 &#x2013;.2 =.8 hits more than an average player. In this case our SS receives a score of + 0.8 on the batted ball. If our shortstop fails to make the play, he has prevented 0 &#x2013;.2 = &#x2013;.2 hits and he receives a score of &#x2013;0.2 on the batted ball. Note if our SS successfully fields 1 in 5 chances in this zone his net score is.8 &#x2013; 4(.2) = 0, as we would hope. If over the course of a season a SS has a net score of &#x2013;20, then he has effectively given up 20 more hits than has an average fielder. A SS with a score of +30 has effectively prevented 30 more hits than has an average fielder.</Run>

Over the course of the 2003&#x2013;5 seasons, Everett&#x2019;s +76 total compared to Jeter&#x2019;s &#x2013;64 total implies that if Everett replaced Jeter as Yankee SS (and if he hit as well as Jeter), then our best estimate is that during the 2003&#x2013;5 seasons the Yankees would have won 11.2 more games (or around 4 games per season).</Run>

      <Run Tag="__76">Suppose two zones (say, 1 and 2) are adjacent and an average fielder is expected to field 20% of the balls hit to zone 1 and 40% of the balls hit to zone 2. What probability of being fielded should be used for a ball hit between the two zones? This is a difficult question to answer. Ideally the probability that an average fielder will field a ball should depend continuously on where the ball is hit and the speed at which the ball is hit. Several Wharton statisticians have performed such an analysis (called Spatial Aggregate Fielding Evaluation [SAFE]). The details of their methodology and their fielding ratings are posted on their Web site, </Run>
