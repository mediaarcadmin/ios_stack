The idea, of course, is that if you are tired you cannot perform at peak performance level. In this chapter we use the following two types of game situations to show that fatigue does indeed have a significantly deleterious impact on team performance:</Run>

      <Run Tag="__301">During the NFL regular season each team gets a week off (&#x201C;bye&#x201D; week). Let&#x2019;s take a look at whether teams play better or worse than expected the week after the bye. Most people believe the week off favors the bye team because the extra week of rest enables injured players to heal and gives the coaches an extra week to prepare for their opponent. Others believe teams get &#x201C;stale&#x201D; or &#x201C;rusty&#x201D; when they have an extra week off. Let the data decide who is right. Our data consist of every post&#x2013;bye week NFL game during the 2003&#x2013;7 regular seasons. We eliminated games in which both teams were coming off a bye week, leaving us) with 146 games in which only one team had a bye (see file Byeweek2.xls. As before, we computed bye team margin prediction = (rating bye team) &#x2013; (rating of non-bye team) + (home edge of +3 if bye team is home or &#x2013;3 points if bye team is away). Then for each game, we define bye team residual = bye team actual margin &#x2013; bye team prediction. Over 146 games the sum of the bye week team residuals was 381.1. Thus, on average, the bye week teams played 386.1/146 = 2.61 points better than expected. Since the standard deviation of the actual margin about a prediction based on the Sagarin ratings is around 14 points, bye week teams played </Run>
