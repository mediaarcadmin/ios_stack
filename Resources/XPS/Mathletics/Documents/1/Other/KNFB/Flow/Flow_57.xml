For example, an offensive team rating of +3 means a team (after adjusting for the strength of opposition) scores 3 points more than average and a defensive rating of &#x2013;5 means that (after adjusting for the strength of opposition) that a team gives up 5 fewer points than average.

We would like to predict team offensive performance as a function of total offensive salary and team defensive performance as a function of defensive salary. To ensure all expenditures are measured in 2004 dollars, we must multiply each team&#x2019;s 2001 expenditures by 1.286, each team&#x2019;s 2002 expenditures by 1.229 and each team&#x2019;s 2003 expenditures by 1.073.

      <Run Tag="__290">Offensive salary explains only 6% of offensive team rating and the correlation between offensive salary and team offensive rating is 0.24. Our best straight line equation for predicting offensive team rating is team rating = &#x2013;5.4957 + .1556(offensive team salary in millions). This equation implies that spending 1/.1556 = $6.42 million will improve offensive team performance by 1 point. The standard error of our regression predictions is 3.97 points. Any team whose predicted offensive performance is off by more than 2 &#xD7; 3.97 = 7.94 points is considered an outlier or unusual observation. This is because in most cases around 95% of predictions from a regression are accurate within 2 standard errors. Notable among the outliers were the 2003 and 2004 Kansas City Chiefs, who outperformed our forecast by around 9 points. These outliers were mostly due to the great performance (20+ touchdowns each year) of Priest Holmes.</Run>

      <Run Tag="xhtml/part04chapter46.html#page_316">The moral of our NBA analysis is that the size of a team&#x2019;s payroll has little effect on a team&#x2019;s performance. One reason that NFL payrolls seem to have a larger influence on team performance than do NBA payrolls is the fact that in the NFL no player&#x2019;s salary is guaranteed. You may cut an NFL player and the team does not have to pay him. This means that if an NFL team signs an expensive free agent and he does not pan out, the team can get his salary off the payroll. In contrast, most NBA contracts are structured such that an NBA team must pay a player even if they cut the player. So if an NBA team commits $100 million to a free agent and he does not fit in or is injured, the team can cut the player but they still have to pay him. In short, front office errors in judgment are much harder to fix in the NBA than in the NFL. If NBA teams are falling victim to the Winner&#x2019;s Curse (as explained in </Run>

Once an NBA team blows $100 million on an overrated player (as when the Pacers signed Jalen Rose to a big contract), they do not have that money to spend on other players and their performance will surely suffer. The fact that NBA front office mistakes are harder to fix is consistent with our observation that extra dollars spent by an NBA team tend to be less effective than extra dollars spent by an NFL team.</Run>
