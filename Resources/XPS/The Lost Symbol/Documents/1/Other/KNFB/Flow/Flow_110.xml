Although he could hold his breath longer than most people, he could already feel his body reacting to the absence of air. Carbon dioxide was accumulating in his blood, bringing with it the instinctual urge to inhale. </Run>

His core muscles had begun burning, and he knew hypoxia was setting in.</Run>
