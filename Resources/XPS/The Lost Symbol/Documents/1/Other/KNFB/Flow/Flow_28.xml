        <Run Tag="__110">Known as &#x201C;The Michelangelo of the Capitol,&#x201D; Brumidi had laid claim to the Capitol Rotunda in the same way Michelangelo had laid claim to the Sistine Chapel, by painting a fresco on the room&#x2019;s most lofty canvas&#x2014;the ceiling. Like Michelangelo, Brumidi had done some of his finest work inside the Vatican. Brumidi, however, immigrated to America in 1852, abandoning God&#x2019;s largest shrine in favor of a new shrine, the U.S. Capitol, which now glistened with examples of his mastery&#x2014;from the trompe l&#x2019;oeil of the Brumidi Corridors to the frieze ceiling of the Vice President&#x2019;s Room. And yet it was the enormous image hovering above the Capitol Rotunda that most historians considered to be Brumidi&#x2019;s masterwork.</Run>
