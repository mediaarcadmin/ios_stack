        <Run Tag="__335"> as it is known, is the centerpiece of the U.S. Botanic Garden (USBG)&#x2014;America&#x2019;s living museum&#x2014;located adjacent to the U.S. Capitol Building. Technically a rain forest, the Jungle is housed in a towering greenhouse, complete with soaring rubber trees, strangler figs, and a canopy catwalk for more daring tourists.</Run>

        <Run Tag="__335">Normally, Warren Bellamy felt nurtured by the Jungle&#x2019;s earthy smells and the sunlight glinting through the mist that filtered down from the vapor nozzles in the glass ceiling. Tonight, however, lit only by moonlight, the Jungle terrified him. He was sweating profusely, writhing against the cramps that now stabbed at his arms, still pinned painfully behind him.</Run>

        <Run Tag="__335">Director Sato paced before him, puffing calmly on her cigarette&#x2014;the equivalent of ecoterrorism in this carefully calibrated environment. Her face looked almost demonic in the smoke-filled moonlight that streamed down through the glass ceiling overhead.</Run>

Rather than making your presence known to me, you descended quietly into the SBB, where, at great risk to yourself, you attacked Chief Anderson and myself, and you helped Langdon escape with the pyramid and capstone.&#x201D; She rubbed her shoulder. &#x201C;An interesting choice.&#x201D;</Run>

        <Run Tag="__335">&#x201C;You seem to know everything else!&#x201D; Bellamy fired back at her, making no attempt to hide his suspicion that she was somehow behind all this. &#x201C;You knew to go to the Capitol Building. You knew to find Robert Langdon. And you even knew to X-ray Langdon&#x2019;s bag to find the capstone. Obviously, someone is giving you a lot of inside information.&#x201D;</Run>

Do you think I&#x2019;m trying to steal your little pyramid?&#x201D; Sato took a drag on her cigarette and blew the smoke out of her nostrils. &#x201C;Listen carefully. No one understands better than I do the importance of keeping secrets. I believe, as you do, that there is certain information to which the masses should not be privy. Tonight, however, there are forces at work that I fear you have not yet grasped. The man who kidnapped Peter Solomon holds enormous power . . . a power that you apparently have yet to realize. Believe me, he is a walking time bomb . . . capable of initiating a series of events that will profoundly change the world as you know it.&#x201D;</Run>

Which means, you are going to call Mr. Langdon and tell him to turn himself in, along with the pyramid and capstone. Once Langdon is in my custody, he will decrypt the pyramid&#x2019;s inscription, obtain whatever information this man is demanding, and provide him with exactly what he wants.&#x201D;</Run>
