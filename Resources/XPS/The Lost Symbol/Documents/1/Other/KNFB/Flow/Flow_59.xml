He slid through the opening and strode confidently across the darkness until his feet hit the carpet. Then he took a right turn and headed for the Cube. The banging on the door of Pod 5 had stopped, and Mal&#x2019;akh suspected the guard was now trying to remove the dime Mal&#x2019;akh had jammed into the key panel to render it useless.</Run>

He entered Trish&#x2019;s PIN and went inside. The lights were all ablaze, and as he moved into the sterile space, he squinted in amazement at the dazzling array of equipment. Mal&#x2019;akh was no stranger to the power of technology; he performed his own breed of science in the basement of his home, and last night some of that science had borne fruit.</Run>

It took him a moment to remove the safety seals and access the cylinder&#x2019;s valve, but once he did, ever so gently, he uncocked the valve. Through the Plexiglas, he could see the clear, bubbling liquid begin draining out of the tube onto the floor inside the storage room. Mal&#x2019;akh watched the puddle expand, oozing across the floor, steaming and bubbling as it grew. Hydrogen remained in liquid form only when it was cold, and as it warmed up, it would start to boil off. The resulting gas, conveniently, was even more flammable than the liquid.</Run>

A whitish mist now rose from the boiling puddle as the liquid hydrogen began turning to gas . . . filling the small space.</Run>
