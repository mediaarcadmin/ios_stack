        <Run Tag="__249"> Nola knew it was not, of course; Director Sato had no sense of humor, and the events of tonight were anything but a joking matter. Nola&#x2019;s high-level clearance within the CIA&#x2019;s all-seeing Office of Security had opened her eyes to the shadow worlds of power. But what Nola had witnessed in the last twenty-four hours had changed her impressions forever of the secrets that powerful men kept.</Run>

However, the cleartext is meaningless. It appears to be a grid of random letters.&#x201D; She gazed down at her decryption.</Run>
