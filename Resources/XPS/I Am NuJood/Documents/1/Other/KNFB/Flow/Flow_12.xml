      <Run Tag="__83">&#x201C;The evening of Nujood&#x2019;s wedding, I couldn&#x2019;t help crying when I saw her, lost in that dress, far too big for her. She was much too young! Hoping to protect her, I even went to talk to her husband. I made him swear before God not to touch her, to wait until she reached puberty, to let her play with children her age. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s a promise,&#x2019; he said. But he didn&#x2019;t keep his word. He&#x2019;s a criminal! Men are all criminals. Never listen to them. Never, never.&#x201D;</Run>

All that suffering, for so many years, endured without a protest or complaint, never raising her voice or taking refuge under a sheltering wing. Mona, my big sister, the prisoner of a fate even more tragic than mine, trapped in a maze of troubles. Her childhood was stolen from her, as mine was from me, but I now understand that, unlike Mona, I&#x2019;ve had the strength to rebel against my fate, and the good fortune to find help.</Run>
