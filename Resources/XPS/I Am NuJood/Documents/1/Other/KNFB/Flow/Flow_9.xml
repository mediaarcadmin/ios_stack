      <Run Tag="__62">When the engine started up, I felt my heart beat wildly; I remembered my brother Fares, and the courage he&#x2019;d shown in fleeing our house four years earlier. He had succeeded, so why shouldn&#x2019;t I? But did I even truly understand what I was doing? What would my father have said if he&#x2019;d seen his daughter get on a public bus all by herself? In so doing, was I staining his honor, as he put it?</Run>

      <Run Tag="__62">The door closed, and it was too late to change my mind. Through the window I watched the city stream by: cars trapped in the morning traffic jams; buildings under construction; black-veiled women; peddlers hawking jasmine flowers, chewing gum, and tissues. Sana&#x2019;a was so big, so full of people! Between the dusty labyrinth of the capital and the isolation of Khardji, I liked Sana&#x2019;a a thousand times more.</Run>

      <Run Tag="__63">We&#x2019;d arrived, and the door had hardly begun to slide open when the hubbub of the stret invaded the minibus. I joined the press of women passengers hurrying to get off, and with trembling fingers handed a few coins to the conductor to pay for my ride. I had no idea at all where the courthouse was, however, and didn&#x2019;t dare ask my fellow passengers for directions. I was overwhelmed with anxiety, as well as the simple fear of getting lost. I looked right, left; a policeman at a broken red light was attempting to keep some order among the madly rushing cars, their horns blaring, trying to pass one another on all sides. I blinked, half dazzled by the rays of the morning sun in the bright blue sky. How could I ever cross a street in such chaos? I would never make it alive. Huddled by a streetlight, I was trying to collect my thoughts when I caught sight of a yellow vehicle. I was saved.</Run>

      <Run Tag="__63">It was one of the many taxis that crisscross the city at all hours of the day and night. In Yemen, as soon as a boy can reach the accelerator, his father buys him a driving license in the hope that he&#x2019;ll land a job as a driver, to help feed the family. I&#x2019;d already taken such taxis, going to Bab al-Yemen with Mona.</Run>

A traffic policeman impatiently waved him on because he was blocking the way. I hurried out of the taxi and handed him the rest of my money. After that exploit, I suddenly felt wildly daring. Confused and terrified, true, but full of spirit! God willing, my life was going to change completely.</Run>
