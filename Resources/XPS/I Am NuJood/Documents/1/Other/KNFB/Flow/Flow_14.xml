I will definitely need some time, and patience. Shada has suggested more than once, actually, that I see a doctor who she says could help me, and each time I&#x2019;ve decided to cancel the appointment at the last minute. It&#x2019;s upsetting, isn&#x2019;t it, to go to a doctor you don&#x2019;t know? So Shada finally gave up.</Run>

What happened to me and to that thirteen-year-old schoolgirl&#x2014;no one talks much about those stories, but there are more of them than you might imagine. A few weeks ago Shada introduced me to Arwa and Rym, two girls who had just filed for divorce. When I saw them for the first time, I gave them big hugs, as if they&#x2019;d been my sisters. Their stories had a huge impact on me. At nine, Arwa was forced by her father to marry a man twenty-five years older than she was, but after hearing about me on the television, she decided one morning to go for help to the hospital nearest her home, in the village of Jibla, to the south of Sana&#x2019;a. Rym was twelve when her life was turned upside down by her parents&#x2019; divorce. For revenge, her father married her off to a thirty-one-year-old cousin. After several attempts at suicide, Rym found the courage to knock on the courthouse door.</Run>

And for the first time in a long while, it&#x2019;s true, our family is once again complete. After the joy of being reunited, however, the quarreling began again, and the other day my sisters had a spat. Although Mona had finally agreed to sign that famous paper to save Jamila, she couldn&#x2019;t help being angry at her, accusing her sister of having broken up her family. Nothing will ever be the same again between the two of them, and yet, all this trouble is the husband&#x2019;s fault. Sometimes I think that one day I will have to speak to Fares and make him promise that if he gets married, he will be the sweetest of husbands.</Run>

One day I, too, will fly away in the sky, and I&#x2019;ll go to the far ends of the earth. It seems that at least three hundred people can fit into an airplane.
