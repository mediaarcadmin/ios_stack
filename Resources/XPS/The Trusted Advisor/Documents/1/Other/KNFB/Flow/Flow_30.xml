We should not wait to bowl them over with blinding insights at the end. Chances are, the insights won&#x2019;t be that blinding. Also, if the conclusions are likely to surprise the client, we shouldn&#x2019;t try to use drama to dazzle. There&#x2019;s nothing worse than an angry client who feels &#x201C;surprised&#x201D; by findings (even if the findings are good), particularly if they&#x2019;re delivered in a semipublic forum or meeting. When we fail to meet agreements we made with a client (not meeting a deadline, going over the budget, falling short of the result we promised), we compromise any trust that we are attempting to develop. Worse yet, if we suggest to our client that perhaps the deadline, the budget, or the result promised were a bit unrealistic, we compromise completely our credibility.</Run>

One of the greatest dangers to the client relationship is telling the client what he or she wants to hear, rather than what is in his or her best interests. Clients can get especially frustrated and disappointed when advisors refuse to accept responsibility, even for unintentional acts. Hearing, &#x201C;It was not my fault,&#x201D; or &#x201C;But that was not my intention&#x201D; strikes clients as a lame defense. They consider it an abdication of responsibility, a diversion of blame, and an infraction in the trust relationship.</Run>

We need to be eternally alert for what comes next for the client. What should our client be doing as a result of our work? Create the follow-on plan for them (at no charge) even if we&#x2019;re not involved in the follow-on. They then might well call us for our counsel. In fact, the chances are good that they will.</Run>
