<p class="para">Among the hissing furze bushes a fire blazed, the flames driven this way and that by the gusts.</p>

<p class="para">An eldritch voice shrieked: &ldquo;When shall we&hellip;two&hellip;meet again?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Thunder rolled.</p>

<p class="para">A rather more ordinary voice said: &ldquo;What&rsquo;d you go and shout that for? You made me drop my toast in the fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Nanny Ogg sat down again.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Sorry, Esme. I was just doing it for&hellip;you know&hellip;old time&rsquo;s sake&hellip;Doesn&rsquo;t roll off the tongue, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just got it nice and brown, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Anyway, you didn&rsquo;t have to shout.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I mean, I ain&rsquo;t deaf. You could&rsquo;ve just asked me in a normal voice. And I&rsquo;d have said, &lsquo;Next Wednesday.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Sorry, Esme.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Just you cut me another slice.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Nanny Ogg nodded, and turned her head. &ldquo;Magrat, cut Granny ano&hellip;oh. Mind wandering <a id="page2"></a>there for a minute. I&rsquo;ll do it myself, shall I?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; said Granny Weatherwax, staring into the fire.</p>

<p class="para">There was no sound for a while but the roar of the wind and the sound of Nanny Ogg cutting bread, which she did with about as much efficiency as a man trying to chainsaw a mattress.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I thought it&rsquo;d cheer you up, coming up here,&rdquo; she said after a while.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Really.&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t a question.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Take you out of yourself, sort of thing&hellip;&rdquo; Nanny went on, watching her friend carefully.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Mm?&rdquo; said Granny, still staring moodily at the fire.</p>

<p class="para">Oh dear, thought Nanny. I shouldn&rsquo;t&rsquo;ve said <span class="italic">that</span>.</p>

<p class="para">The point was&hellip;well, the point was that Nanny Ogg was worried. Very worried. She wasn&rsquo;t at all sure that her friend wasn&rsquo;t&hellip;well&hellip;going&hellip;well, sort of&hellip;in a manner of speaking&hellip;well&hellip;black&hellip;</p>

<p class="para">She knew it happened, with the really powerful ones. And Granny Weatherwax was pretty damn powerful. She was probably an even more accomplished witch now than the infamous Black Aliss, and everyone knew what had happened to <span class="italic">her</span> at the finish. Pushed into her own stove by a couple of kids, and everyone said it was a damn good thing, even if it took a whole week to clean the oven.</p>

<p class="para">But Aliss, up until that terrible day, had terrorized the Ramtops. She&rsquo;d become so good at magic that there wasn&rsquo;t room in her head for anything else.</p>

<p class="para">They said weapons couldn&rsquo;t pierce her. Swords bounced off her skin. They said you could hear her <a id="page3"></a>mad laughter a mile off, and of course, while mad laughter was always part of a witch&rsquo;s stock-in-trade in necessary circumstances, this was <span class="italic">insane</span> mad laughter, the worst kind. And she turned people into gingerbread and had a house made of frogs. It had been very nasty, toward the end. It always was, when a witch went bad.</p>

<p class="para">Sometimes, of course, they didn&rsquo;t go bad. They just went&hellip;somewhere.</p>

<p class="para">Granny&rsquo;s intellect needed something to <span class="italic">do</span>. She did not take kindly to boredom. She&rsquo;d take to her bed instead and send her mind out Borrowing, inside the head of some forest creature, listening with its ears, seeing with its eyes. That was all very well for general purposes, but she was too good at it. She could stay away longer than anyone Nanny Ogg had ever heard of.</p>

<p class="para">One day, almost certainly, she wouldn&rsquo;t bother to come back&hellip;and this was the worst time of the year, with the geese honking and rushing across the sky every night, and the autumn air crisp and inviting. There was something terribly tempting about that.</p>

<p class="para">Nanny Ogg reckoned she knew what the cause of the problem was.</p>

<p class="para">She coughed.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Saw Magrat the other day,&rdquo; she ventured, looking sidelong at Granny.</p>

<p class="para">There was no reaction.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s looking well. Queening suits her.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Nanny groaned inwardly. If Granny couldn&rsquo;t even be bothered to make a nasty remark, then she was <span class="italic">really</span> missing Magrat.</p>

<p class="para">Nanny Ogg had never believed it at the start, <a id="page4"></a>but Magrat Garlick, wet as a sponge though she was half the time, had been dead right about one thing.</p>

<p class="para">Three was a natural number for witches.</p>

<p class="para">And they&rsquo;d lost one. Well, not lost, exactly. Magrat was queen now, and queens were hard to mislay. But&hellip;that meant that there were only two of them instead of three.</p>

<p class="para">When you had three, you had one to run around getting people to make up when there&rsquo;d been a row. Magrat had been good for that. Without Magrat, Nanny Ogg and Granny Weatherwax got on one another&rsquo;s nerves. With her, all three had been able to get on the nerves of absolutely everyone else in the whole world, which had been a lot more fun.</p>

<p class="para">And there was no having Magrat back&hellip;at least, to be precise about it, there was no having Magrat back <span class="italic">yet</span>.</p>

<p class="para">Because, while three was a good number for witches&hellip;it had to be the <span class="italic">right</span> sort of three. The right sort of&hellip;<span class="italic">types</span>.</p>

<p class="para">Nanny Ogg found herself embarrassed even to think about this, and this was unusual because embarrassment normally came as naturally to Nanny as altruism comes to a cat.</p>

<p class="para">As a witch, she naturally didn&rsquo;t believe in any occult nonsense of any sort. But there were one or two truths down below the bedrock of the soul which had to be faced, and right in among them was this business of, well, of the maiden, the mother and the&hellip;other one.</p>

<p class="para">There. She&rsquo;d put words around it.</p>

<p class="para">Of course, it was nothing but an old superstition <a id="page5"></a>and belonged to the unenlightened days when &ldquo;maiden&rdquo; or &ldquo;mother&rdquo; or&hellip;the other one&hellip;encompassed every woman over the age of twelve or so, except maybe for nine months of her life. These days, any girl bright enough to count and sensible enough to take Nanny&rsquo;s advice could put off being at least one of them for quite some time.</p>

<p class="para">Even so&hellip;it was an <span class="italic">old</span> superstition&mdash;older than books, older than writing&mdash;and beliefs like that were heavy weights on the rubber sheet of human experience, tending to pull people into their orbit.</p>

<p class="para">And Magrat had been married for three months. That ought to mean she was out of the first category. At least&mdash;Nanny twitched her train of thought on to a branch line&mdash;she <span class="italic">probably</span> was. Oh, <span class="italic">surely</span>. Young Verence had sent off for a helpful manual. It had pictures in it, and numbered parts. Nanny knew this because she had sneaked into the royal bedroom while visiting one day, and had spent an instructive ten minutes drawing mustaches and spectacles on some of the figures. Surely even Magrat and Verence could hardly fail to&hellip;No, they must have worked it out, even though Nanny had heard that Verence had been seen inquiring of people where he might buy a couple of false mustaches. It&rsquo;d not be long before Magrat was eligible for the second category, even if they were both slow readers.</p>

<p class="para">Of course, Granny Weatherwax made a great play of her independence and self-reliance. But the point about that kind of stuff was that you needed someone around to be proudly independent and self-reliant <span class="italic">at</span>. People who didn&rsquo;t need people <a id="page6"></a>needed people around to know that they were the kind of people who didn&rsquo;t need people.</p>

<p class="para">It was like hermits. There was no point freezing your nadgers off on top of some mountain while communing with the Infinite unless you could rely on a lot of impressionable young women to come along occasionally and say &ldquo;Gosh.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">They needed to be three again. Things got exciting, when there were three of you. There were rows, and adventures, and things for Granny to get angry about, and she was only happy when she was angry. In fact, it seemed to Nanny, she was only Granny Weatherwax when she was angry.</p>

<p class="para">Yes. They needed to be three.</p>

<p class="para">Or else&hellip;it was going to be gray wings in the night, or the clang of the oven door&hellip;</p>

<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent">The manuscript fell apart as soon as Mr. Goatberger picked it up.</p>

<p class="para">It wasn&rsquo;t even on proper paper. It had been written on old sugar bags, and the backs of envelopes, and bits of out-of-date calendar.</p>

<p class="para">He grunted, and grabbed a handful of the musty pages to throw them on the fire.</p>

<p class="para">A word caught his eye.</p>

<p class="para">He read it, and his eye was dragged to the end of the sentence.</p>

<p class="para">Then he read to the end of the page, doubling back a few times because he hadn&rsquo;t quite believed what he&rsquo;d just read.</p>

<p class="para">He turned the page. And then he turned back. And then he read on. At one point he took a ruler out of his drawer and looked at it thoughtfully.</p>
<a id="page7"></a>

<p class="para">He opened his drinks cabinet. The bottle tinkled cheerfully on the edge of the glass as he tried to pour himself a drink.</p>

<p class="para">Then he stared out of the window at the Opera House on the other side of the road. A small figure was brushing the steps.</p>

<p class="para">And then he said, &ldquo;Oh, my.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Finally he went to the door and said, &ldquo;Could you come in here, Mr. Cropper?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">His chief printer entered, clutching a sheaf of proofs. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have to get Mr. Cripslock to engrave page II again,&rdquo; he said mournfully. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s spelled &lsquo;famine&rsquo; with seven letters&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Read this,&rdquo; said Goatberger.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I was just off to lunch&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Read this.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Guild agreement says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Read this and see if you still have an appetite.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Mr. Cropper sat down with bad grace and glanced at the first page.</p>

<p class="para">Then he turned to the second page.</p>

<p class="para">After a while he opened the desk drawer and pulled out a ruler, which he looked at thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just read about Bananana Soup Surprise?&rdquo; said Goatberger.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;You wait till you get to Spotted Dick.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Well, my old granny used to make Spotted Dick&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Not to this recipe,&rdquo; said Goatberger, with absolute certainty.</p>

<p class="para">Cropper fumbled through the pages. &ldquo;Blimey! Do you think any of this stuff works?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Who cares? Go down to the Guild right now <a id="page8"></a>and hire all the engravers that&rsquo;re free. Preferably elderly ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve still got the Grune, June, August and Spune predictions for next year&rsquo;s Almanac to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Forget them. Use some old ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;People&rsquo;ll notice.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve never noticed before,&rdquo; said Mr. Goatberger. &ldquo;You know the drill. Astounding Rains of Curry in Klatch, Amazing Death of the Seriph of Ee, Plague of Wasps in Howondaland. This is a lot more important.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">He stared unseeing out of the window again.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;<span class="italic">Considerably</span> more important.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">And he dreamed the dream of all those who publish books, which was to have so much gold in your pockets that you would have to employ two people just to hold your trousers up.</p>

<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent">The huge, be-columned, gargoyle-haunted face of Ankh-Morpork&rsquo;s Opera House was there, in front of Agnes Nitt.</p>

<p class="para">She stopped. At least, <span class="italic">most</span> of Agnes stopped. There was a lot of Agnes. It took some time for outlying regions to come to rest.</p>

<p class="para">Well, this was it. At last. She could go in, or she could go away. It was what they called a life choice. She&rsquo;d never had one of those before.</p>

<p class="para">Finally, after standing still for long enough for a pigeon to consider the perching possibilities of her huge and rather sad black floppy hat, she climbed the steps.</p>

<p class="para">A man was theoretically sweeping them. What he was in <span class="italic">fact</span> doing was moving the dirt around with a <a id="page9"></a>broom, to give it a change of scenery and a chance to make new friends. He was dressed in a long coat that was slightly too small for him, and had a black beret perched incongruously on spiky black hair.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Agnes.</p>

<p class="para">The effect was electric. He turned around, tangled one foot with the other, and collapsed onto his broom.</p>

<p class="para">Agnes&rsquo;s hand flew to her mouth, and then she reached down.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">The hand had that clammy feel that makes a holder think longingly of soap. He pulled it away quickly, pushed his greasy hair out of his eyes and gave her a terrified smile; he had what Nanny Ogg called an underdone face, its features rubbery and pale.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;No trouble miss!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">He scrambled up, got the broom somehow tangled between his knees, and sat down again sharply.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Er&hellip;shall I hold the broom?&rdquo; said Agnes helpfully.</p>

<p class="para">She pulled it out of the tangle. He got up again, after a couple of false starts.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Do you work for the Opera House?&rdquo; said Agnes.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes miss!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Er, can you tell me where I have to go for the auditions?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">He looked around wildly. &ldquo;Stage door!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you!&rdquo; The words came out in a rush, as if he had to line them up and fire them all in one go before they had time to wander off.</p>
<a id="page10"></a>

<p class="para">He snatched the broom out of her hands and set off down the steps and toward the corner of the building. He had a unique stride: it looked as though his body were being dragged forward and his legs had to flail around underneath it, landing wherever they could find room. It wasn&rsquo;t so much a walk as a collapse, indefinitely postponed.</p>

<p class="para">His erratic footsteps led toward a door in the side wall. Agnes followed them in.</p>

<p class="para">Just inside was a sort of shed, with one open wall and a counter positioned so that someone standing there could watch the door. The person behind it must have been a human being because walruses don&rsquo;t wear coats. The strange man had disappeared somewhere in the gloom beyond.</p>

<p class="para">Agnes looked around desperately.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes, miss?&rdquo; said the walrus man. It really was an <span class="italic">impressive</span> mustache, which had sapped all the growth from the rest of its owner.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Er&hellip;I&rsquo;m here for the&hellip;the auditions,&rdquo; said Agnes. &ldquo;I saw a notice that said you were auditioning&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">She gave a helpless little smile. The doorkeeper&rsquo;s face proclaimed that it had seen and been unimpressed by more desperate smiles than even Agnes could have eaten hot dinners. He produced a clipboard and a stub of pencil.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;You got to sign here,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Who was that&hellip;person who came in with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">The mustache moved, suggesting a smile was buried somewhere below. &ldquo;Everyone knows our Walter Plinge.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">This seemed to be all the information that was likely to be imparted.</p>
<a id="page11"></a>

<p class="para">Agnes gripped the pencil.</p>

<p class="para">The most important question was: what should she call herself? Her name had many sterling qualities, no doubt, but it didn&rsquo;t exactly roll off the tongue. It snapped off the palate and clicked between the teeth, but it didn&rsquo;t roll off the tongue.</p>

<p class="para">The trouble was, she couldn&rsquo;t think of one with great rotational capabilities.</p>

<p class="para">Catherine, possibly.</p>

<p class="para">Or&hellip;Perdita. She could go back to trying Perdita. She&rsquo;d been embarrassed out of using that name in Lancre. It was a mysterious name, hinting of darkness and intrigue and, incidentally, of someone who was quite thin. She&rsquo;d even given herself a middle initial&mdash;X&mdash;which stood for &ldquo;someone who has a cool and exciting middle initial.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">It hadn&rsquo;t worked. Lancre people were depressingly resistant to cool. She had just been known as &ldquo;that Agnes who calls herself Perditax.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">She&rsquo;d never <span class="italic">dared</span> tell anyone that she&rsquo;d like her <span class="italic">full</span> name to be Perdita X Dream. They just wouldn&rsquo;t <span class="italic">understand</span>. They&rsquo;d say things like: if you think that&rsquo;s the right name for you, why have you still got two shelves full of soft toys?</p>

<p class="para">Well, here she could start afresh. She was good. She knew she was good.</p>

<p class="para">Probably no hope for the Dream, though.</p>

<p class="para">She was probably stuck with the Nitt.</p>

<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent">Nanny Ogg usually went to bed early. After all, she was an old lady. Sometimes she went to bed as early as six <span class="smallCaps">A.M.</span></p>
<a id="page12"></a>

<p class="para">Her breath puffed in the air as she walked through the woods. Her boots crunched on the leaves. The wind had died away, leaving the sky wide and clear and open for the first frost of the season, a petal-nipping, fruit-withering little scorcher that showed you why they called Nature a mother&hellip;</p>

<p class="para">A third witch, she thought.</p>

<p class="para">Three witches could sort of&hellip;spread the load.</p>

<p class="para">Maiden, mother and&hellip;crone. There.</p>

<p class="para">The trouble was that Granny Weatherwax combined all three in one. She was a maiden, as far as Nanny knew, and she was at least in the right age-bracket for a crone; and, as for the third, well&hellip;cross Granny Weatherwax on a bad day and you&rsquo;d be like a blossom in the frost.</p>

<p class="para">There was bound to be a candidate for the vacancy, though. There were several young girls in Lancre who were just about the right age.</p>

<p class="para">Trouble was, the young men of Lancre knew it too. Nanny wandered the summer hayfields regularly, and had a sharp if compassionate eye and damn good over-the-horizon hearing. Violet Frottidge was walking out with young Deviousness Carter, or at least doing something within ninety degrees of walking out. Bonnie Quarney had been gathering nuts in May with William Simple, and it was only because she&rsquo;d thought ahead and taken a little advice from Nanny that she wouldn&rsquo;t be bearing fruit in February. And pretty soon now young Mildred Tinker&rsquo;s mother would have a quiet word with Mildred Tinker&rsquo;s father, and <span class="italic">he&rsquo;d</span> have a word with his friend Thatcher and <span class="italic">he&rsquo;d</span> have a word with his son Hob, and then there&rsquo;d be a wedding, all <a id="page13"></a>done in a properly civilized way except for maybe a black eye or two.<span class="footnoteRef"><a href="footnote.xhtml#ft1" id="ft_1">*</a></span> No doubt about it, thought Nanny with a misty-eyed smile: innocence, in a hot Lancre summer, was that state in which innocence is lost.</p>

<p class="para">And then a name rose out of the throng. Oh, yes. <span class="italic">Her</span>. Why hadn&rsquo;t she thought of <span class="italic">her</span>? But you didn&rsquo;t, of course. Whenever you thought about the young girls of Lancre, you didn&rsquo;t remember her. And then you said, &ldquo;Oh, yes, her too, of course. O&rsquo; course, she&rsquo;s got a wonderful personality. And good hair, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">She was bright, and talented. In many ways. Her voice, for one thing. That was her power, finding its way out. And of course she also had a wonderful personality, so there&rsquo;d be not much chance of her being&hellip;disqualified&hellip;</p>

<p class="para">Well, that was settled, then. Another witch to bully and impress would set Granny up a treat, and Agnes would be bound to thank her eventually.</p>

<p class="para">Nanny Ogg was relieved. You needed at least three witches for a coven. Two witches was just an argument.</p>

<p class="para">She opened the door of her cottage and climbed the stairs to bed.</p>

<p class="para">Her cat, the tom Greebo, was spread out on the eiderdown like a puddle of gray fur. He didn&rsquo;t even awake as Nanny lifted him up bodily so that, nightdress-clad, she could slide between the sheets.</p>

<p class="para">Just to keep bad dreams at bay, she took a swig out of a bottle that smelled of apples and happy brain-death. Then she pummeled her pillow, <a id="page14"></a>thought &ldquo;Her&hellip;yes,&rdquo; and drifted off to sleep.</p>

<p class="para">Presently Greebo awoke, stretched, yawned and hopped silently to the floor. Then the most vicious and cunning a pile of fur that ever had the intelligence to sit on a bird table with its mouth open and a piece of toast balanced on its nose vanished through the open window.</p>

<p class="para">A few minutes later, the cockerel in the garden next door stuck up his head to greet the bright new day and died instantly in mid- &ldquo;doodle-doo.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent">There was a huge darkness in front of Agnes while, at the same time, she was half-blinded by the light. Just below the edge of the stage, giant flat candles floated in a long trough of water, producing a strong yellow glare quite unlike the oil lamps of home. Beyond the light, the auditorium waited like the mouth of a very big and extremely hungry animal.</p>

<p class="para">From somewhere on the far side of the lights a voice said, &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re ready, miss.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">It wasn&rsquo;t a particularly unfriendly voice. It just wanted her to get on with it, sing her piece, and go.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve, er, got this song, it&rsquo;s a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve given your music to Miss Proudlet?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Er, there isn&rsquo;t an accompaniment actually, it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a <span class="italic">folk</span> song, is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">There was a whispering in the darkness, and someone laughed quietly.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Off you go then&hellip;Perdita, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Agnes launched into the Hedgehog Song, and knew by about word seven that it had been the wrong choice. You needed a tavern, with people leering and thumping their mugs on the table. This <a id="page15"></a>big brilliant emptiness just sucked at it and made her voice hesitant and shrill.</p>

<p class="para">She stopped at the end of verse three. She could feel the blush starting somewhere around her knees. It&rsquo;d take some time to get to her face, because it had a lot of skin to cover, but by then it&rsquo;d be strawberry pink.</p>

<p class="para">She could hear whispering. Words like &ldquo;timbre&rdquo; emerged from the susurration and then, she wasn&rsquo;t surprised to hear, came &ldquo;impressive build.&rdquo; She did, she knew, have an impressive build. So did the Opera House. She didn&rsquo;t have to feel good about it.</p>

<p class="para">The voice spoke up.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t had much training, have you, dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Which was true. Lancre&rsquo;s only other singer of note was Nanny Ogg, whose attitude to songs was purely ballistic. You just pointed your voice at the end of the verse and went for it.</p>

<p class="para">Whisper, whisper.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Sing us a few scales, dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">The blush was at chest-height now, thundering across the rolling acres&hellip;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Scales?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Whisper. Muffled laugh.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Do-Re-Mi? You know, dear? Starting low? La-la-lah?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Oh. Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">As the armies of embarrassment stormed her neckline, Agnes pitched her voice as low as she could and went for it.</p>

<p class="para">She concentrated on the notes, working her way stolidly upward from sea-level to mountaintop, and took no notice at the start when a chair <a id="page16"></a>vibrated across the stage or, at the end, when a glass broke somewhere and several bats fell out of the roof.</p>

<p class="para">There was silence from the big emptiness, except for the thud of another bat and, far above, a gentle tinkle of glass.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Is&hellip;is that your full range, lass?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">People were clustering in the wings and staring at her.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;If I go any higher people faint,&rdquo; said Agnes. &ldquo;And if I go lower everyone says it makes them feel uncomfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Whisper, whisper. Whisper, <span class="italic">whisper</span>, whisper.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;And, er, any other&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Granny Weatherwax rolled her eyes, and sighed. &ldquo;Can you sit down?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;No, miss. I can fall over on a chair, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Granny truthfully. She&rsquo;d long ago been resigned to the fact that people expected a bottle of something funny-colored and sticky. It wasn&rsquo;t the medicine that did the trick, though. It was, in a way, the spoon.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;This is a mixture of rare herbs and suchlike,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Including sucrose and akwa.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;My word,&rdquo; said Jarge, impressed.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Take a swig now.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Weaver was never quite certain about what happened next. Granny, usually so sure on her feet, seemed to trip over one of his sticks as she went through the door, and fell backward, holding his shoulders, and somehow her knee came up and hit a spot on his backbone as she twisted sideways, and there was a <span class="italic">click</span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="para">Granny watched him go, shaking her head.</p>

<p class="para">People were so <span class="italic">blind</span>, she reflected. They preferred to believe in gibberish rather than chiropracty.</p>

<p class="para">Of course, it was just as well this was so.

<p class="para">But what had she done? She&rsquo;d just tricked a rather dim old man.</p>

<p class="para">She&rsquo;d faced wizards, monsters and elves&hellip;and now she was feeling pleased with herself because she&rsquo;d fooled Jarge Weaver, a man who&rsquo;d twice failed to become Village Idiot through being over-qualified.</p>

<p class="para">It was the slippery slope. Next thing it&rsquo;d be cackling and gibbering and luring children into the oven. And it wasn&rsquo;t as if she even <span class="italic">liked</span> children.</p>

<p class="para">For years Granny Weatherwax had been contented enough with the challenge that village witchcraft could offer.

<p class="para">She looked around at the kitchen. It needed sweeping. The washing-up needed doing. The walls had grown grubby. There seemed to be so much to do that she couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to do any of it.</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent">The selection committee sat around the table in the office of Mr. Seldom Bucket, the Opera House&rsquo;s new owner. He&rsquo;d been joined by Salzella, the musical director, and Dr. Undershaft, the chorus master.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said Mr. Bucket, &ldquo;we come to&hellip;let&rsquo;s see&hellip;yes, Christine&hellip;Marvelous stage presence, eh? Good figure, too.&rdquo; He winked at Dr. Undershaft.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes. Very pretty,&rdquo; said Dr. Undershaft flatly. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t sing, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;What you artistic types don&rsquo;t realize is this is the Century of the Fruitbat,&rdquo; said Bucket. &ldquo;Opera is a production, not just a lot of songs.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;So you say. But&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;The idea that a soprano should be fifteen acres of bosom in a horned helmet belongs to the past, like.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Salzella and Undershaft exchanged glances. So he was going to be <span class="italic">that</span> kind of owner&hellip;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Unfortunately,&rdquo; said Salzella sourly, &ldquo;the idea <a id="page22"></a>that a soprano should have a reasonable singing voice does not belong to the past. She has a good figure, yes. She certainly has a&hellip;sparkle. But she can&rsquo;t <span class="italic">sing</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;You can train her, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Bucket. &ldquo;A few years in the chorus&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes, maybe after a few years, if I persevere, she will be merely very bad,&rdquo; said Undershaft.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Er, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mr. Bucket. &ldquo;Ahem. All right. Cards on the table, eh? I&rsquo;m a simple man, me. No beating about the bush, speak as you find, call a spade a spade&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Do give us your forthright views,&rdquo; said Salzella. <span class="italic">Definitely</span> that kind of owner, he thought. Self-made man proud of his handiwork. Confuses bluffness and honesty with merely being rude. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind betting a dollar that he thinks he can tell a man&rsquo;s character by testing the firmness of his handshake and looking deeply into his eyes.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been through the mill, I have,&rdquo; Bucket began, &ldquo;and I made myself what I am today&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Self-raising flour? thought Salzella.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;&mdash;but I have to, er, declare a bit of a financial interest. Her dad did, er, in fact, er, lend me a fair whack of money to help me buy this place, and he made a heartfelt fatherly request in regard to his daughter. If I bring it to mind correctly, his exact words, er, were: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t make me have to break your legs.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t expect you <span class="italic">artistes</span> to understand. It&rsquo;s a business thing. The gods help those who help themselves, that&rsquo;s my motto.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Salzella stuck his hands in his waistcoat pockets, leaned back and started to whistle softly.</p>
<a id="page23"></a>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I <span class="italic">see</span>,&rdquo; said Undershaft. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not the first time it&rsquo;s happened. Normally it&rsquo;s a ballerina, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s nothing like <span class="italic">that</span>,&rdquo; said Bucket hurriedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that with the money comes this girl Christine. And you have to admit, she does <span class="italic">look</span> good.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; said Salzella. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your Opera House, I&rsquo;m sure. And now&hellip;Perdita&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">They smiled at one another.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Perdita!&rdquo; said Bucket, relieved to get the Christine business over so that he could go back to being bluff and honest again.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Perdita X,&rdquo; Salzella corrected him.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;What will these girls think of next?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I think she will prove an asset,&rdquo; said Undershaft.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes, if we ever do that opera with the elephants.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;But the range&hellip;what a range she&rsquo;s got&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Quite. I saw you staring.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I <span class="italic">meant</span> her <span class="italic">voice</span>, Salzella. She will add body to the chorus.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;She <span class="italic">is</span> a chorus. We could sack everyone else. Ye gods, she can even sing in harmony with herself. But can you see her in a major role?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Good grief, no. We&rsquo;d be a laughingstock.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Quite so. She seems quite&hellip;amenable, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Wonderful personality, I thought. And good hair, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent">She&rsquo;d never expected it to be this easy&hellip;</p>

<p class="para">Agnes listened in a kind of trance while people <a id="page24"></a>talked at her about wages (very little), the need for training (a lot), and accommodation (members of the chorus lived in the Opera House itself, up near the roof).</p>

<p class="para">And then, more or less, she was forgotten about. She stood and watched at the side of the stage while a group of ballet hopefuls were put through their delicate paces.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;You do have an amazing voice,&rdquo; said someone behind her.</p>

<p class="para">She turned. As Nanny Ogg had once remarked, it was an education seeing Agnes turn around. She was light enough on her feet but the inertia of outlying parts meant that bits of Agnes were still trying to work out which way to face for some time afterward.</p>

<p class="para">The girl who had spoken to her was slightly built, even by ordinary standards, and had gone to some pains to make herself look even thinner. She had long blond hair and the happy smile of someone who is aware that she is thin and has long blond hair.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Christine!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this exciting?!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">And she had the type of voice that can exclaim a question. It seemed to have an excited little squeak permanently screwed to it.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Er, yes,&rdquo; said Agnes.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for this day for <span class="italic">years</span>!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Agnes had been waiting for it for about twenty-four hours, ever since she&rsquo;d seen the notice outside the Opera House. But she&rsquo;d be danged if she&rsquo;d say that.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Where did you train?!&rdquo; said Christine. &ldquo;I spent <a id="page25"></a>three years with Mme. Venturi at the Quirm Conservatory!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Um. I was&hellip;&rdquo; Agnes hesitated, trying out the upcoming sentence in her head. &ldquo;&hellip;I trained with&hellip;Dame Ogg. But she hasn&rsquo;t got a conservatory, because it&rsquo;s hard to get the glass up the mountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Christine didn&rsquo;t appear to want to question this. Anything she found too difficult to understand, she ignored.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;The money in the chorus isn&rsquo;t very good, is it?!&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;No.&rdquo; It was less than you&rsquo;d get for scrubbing floors. The reason was that, when you advertised a dirty floor, hundreds of hopefuls didn&rsquo;t turn up.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do! Besides, there&rsquo;s the status!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes, I expect there is.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to look at the rooms we get! They&rsquo;re very poky! What room have you been given?!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Agnes looked down blankly at the key she had been handed, along with many sharp instructions about <span class="italic">no men</span> and an unpleasant not-that-you-need-telling expression on the chorus mistress&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Oh&hellip;17.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Christine clapped her hands. &ldquo;Oh, goody!!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Pardon?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <span class="italic">so</span> glad!! You&rsquo;re next to me!!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Agnes was taken aback. She&rsquo;d always been resigned to being the last to be picked in the great team game of Life.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Well&hellip;yes, I suppose so&hellip;&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so lucky!! You&rsquo;ve got such a majestic <a id="page26"></a>figure for opera!! And such marvelous hair, the way you pile it up like that!! Black suits you, by the way!!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Majestic, thought Agnes. It was a word that would never, ever have occurred to her. And she&rsquo;d always steered away from white because in white she looked like a washing-line on a windy day.</p>

<p class="para">She followed Christine.</p>

<p class="para">It occurred to Agnes, as she trudged after the girl en route to her new lodgings, that if you spent much time in the same room as Christine you&rsquo;d need to open a window to stop from drowning in punctuation.</p>

<p class="para">From somewhere at the back of the stage, quite unheeded, someone watched them go.</p>

<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent">People were generally glad to see Nanny Ogg. She was good at making them feel at home in their own home.</p>

<p class="para">But she <span class="italic">was</span> a witch, and therefore also expert at arriving just after cakes were baked or sausages were made. Nanny Ogg generally traveled with a string bag stuffed up one knee-length knicker leg&mdash;in case, as she put it, someone wants to give me something.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;So, Mrs. Nitt,&rdquo; she observed, around about the third cake and fourth cup of tea, &ldquo;how&rsquo;s that daughter of yours? Agnes it is to whom I refer.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Oh, didn&rsquo;t you hear, Mrs. Ogg? She&rsquo;s gone off to Ankh-Morpork to be a singer.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Nanny Ogg&rsquo;s heart sank.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She has a good singing voice, I remember. Of course, I gave her a few tips. <a id="page27"></a>I used to hear her singing in the woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the air here,&rdquo; said Mrs. Nitt. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s always had such a good chest.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes, indeed. Noted for it. So&hellip;er&hellip;she&rsquo;s not here, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;You know our Agnes. She never says much. I think she thought it was a bit dull.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Dull? Lancre?&rdquo; said Nanny Ogg.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I said,&rdquo; said Mrs. Nitt. &ldquo;I said we get some lovely sunsets up here. And there&rsquo;s the fair every Soul Cake Tuesday, regular.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Nanny Ogg thought about Agnes. You needed quite large thoughts to fit all of Agnes in.</p>

<p class="para">Lancre had always bred strong, capable women. A Lancre farmer needed a wife who&rsquo;d think nothing of beating a wolf to death with her apron when she went out to get some firewood. And, while kissing initially seemed to have more charms than cookery, a stolid Lancre lad looking for a bride would bear in mind his father&rsquo;s advice that kisses eventually lost their fire but cookery tended to get even better over the years, and direct his courting to those families that clearly showed a tradition of enjoying their food.</p>

<p class="para">Agnes was, Nanny considered, quite good-looking in an expansive kind of way; she was a fine figure of typical young Lancre womanhood. This meant she was approximately two womanhoods from anywhere else.</p>

<p class="para">Nanny also recalled her as being rather thoughtful and shy, as if trying to reduce the amount of world she took up.</p>

<p class="para">But she had shown signs of craft ability. That was only to be expected. There was nothing like <a id="page28"></a>that <span class="italic">not fitting in</span> feeling to stimulate the old magical nerves; that was why Esme was so good at it. In Agnes&rsquo;s case this had manifested itself in a tendency to wear soppy black lace gloves and pale makeup and call herself Perdita plus an initial from the arse of the alphabet, but Nanny had assumed that would soon burn off when she got some serious witchcraft under her rather strained belt.</p>

<p class="para">She should have paid more attention to the thing about music. Power found its way out by all sorts of routes&hellip;</p>

<p class="para">Music and magic had a lot in common. They were only two letters apart, for one thing. And you couldn&rsquo;t do both.</p>

<p class="para">Damn. Nanny had rather been counting on the girl.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;She used to send off to Ankh-Morpork for music,&rdquo; said Mrs. Nitt. &ldquo;See?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">She handed Nanny several piles of papers.</p>

<p class="para">Nanny leafed through them. Song sheets were common enough in the Ramtops, and a singsong in the parlor was considered the third best thing to do on long dark evenings. But Nanny could see this wasn&rsquo;t ordinary music. It was far too crowded for that.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;<span class="italic">Cosi fan Hita</span>,&rdquo; she read. &ldquo;<span class="italic">Die Meistersinger von Scrote.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s foreign,&rdquo; said Mrs. Nitt proudly.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;It certainly is,&rdquo; said Nanny.</p>

<p class="para">Mrs. Nitt was looking expectantly at her.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Nanny, and then, &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Mrs. Nitt&rsquo;s eyes flickered to her emptied teacup and back again.</p>

<p class="para">Nanny Ogg sighed and laid the music aside. <a id="page29"></a>Occasionally she saw Granny Weatherwax&rsquo;s point. Sometimes people expected too little of witches.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes, indeedy,&rdquo; she said, trying to smile. &ldquo;Let us see what destiny in the form of these dried-up bits of leaf has in store for us, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">She set her features in a suitable occult expression and looked down into the cup.</p>

<p class="para">Which, a second later, smashed into fragments when it hit the floor.</p>

<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent">It was a small room. In fact it was half a small room, since a thin wall had been built across it. Junior members of the chorus ranked rather lower in the opera than apprentice scene shifters.</p>

<p class="para">There was room for a bed, a wardrobe, a dressingtable and, quite out of place, a huge mirror, as big as the door.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Impressive, isn&rsquo;t it?!&rdquo; said Christine. &ldquo;They tried to take it out but it&rsquo;s built into the wall, apparently!! I&rsquo;m sure it will be very useful!!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Agnes said nothing. Her own half-room, the other half of this one, didn&rsquo;t have a mirror. She was glad of that. She did not regard mirrors as naturally friendly. It wasn&rsquo;t just the images they showed her. There was something&hellip;<span class="italic">worrying&hellip;</span>about mirrors. She&rsquo;d always felt that. They seemed to be looking at her. Agnes hated being looked at.</p>

<p class="para">Christine stepped into the small space in the middle of the floor and twirled. There was something very enjoyable about watching her. It was the sparkle, Agnes thought. Something about Christine suggested sequins.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this nice?!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<a id="page30"></a>

<p class="para">Not liking Christine would be like not liking small fluffy animals. And Christine was just like a small fluffy animal. A rabbit, perhaps. It was certainly impossible for her to get a whole idea into her head in one go. She had to nibble it into manageable bits.</p>

<p class="para">Agnes glanced at the mirror again. Her reflection stared at her. She could have done with some time to herself right now. Everything had happened so quickly. And this place made her uneasy. Everything would feel a lot better if she could just have some time to herself.</p>

<p class="para">Christine stopped twirling. &ldquo;Are you all right?!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Agnes nodded.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Do <span class="italic">tell</span> me about yourself!!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Er&hellip;well&hellip;&rdquo; Agnes was gratified, despite herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m from somewhere up in the mountains you&rsquo;ve probably never heard of&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">She stopped. A light had gone off in Christine&rsquo;s head, and Agnes realized that the question had been asked not because Christine in any way wanted to know the answer but for something to say. She went on: &ldquo;&hellip;and my father is the Emperor of Klatch and my mother is a small tray of raspberry puddings.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s interesting!&rdquo; said Christine, who was looking at the mirror. &ldquo;Do you think my hair looks right?!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent">What Agnes would have said, if Christine had been capable of listening to anything for more than a couple of seconds, was:</p>

<p class="para">She&rsquo;d woken up one morning with the horrible <a id="page31"></a>realization that she&rsquo;d been saddled with a lovely personality. It was as simple as that. Oh, and very good hair.</p>

<p class="para">It wasn&rsquo;t so much the personality, it was the &ldquo;but&rdquo; that people always added when they talked about it. <span class="italic">But she&rsquo;s got a lovely personality</span>, they said. It was the lack of choice that rankled. No one had asked her, before she was born, whether she wanted a lovely personality or whether she&rsquo;d prefer, say, a miserable personality but a body that could take size nine in dresses. Instead, people would take pains to tell her that beauty was only skin-deep, as if a man ever fell for an attractive pair of kidneys.</p>

<p class="para">She could feel a future trying to land on her.</p>

<p class="para">She&rsquo;d caught herself saying &ldquo;poot!&rdquo; and &ldquo;dang!&rdquo; when she wanted to swear, and using pink writing paper.</p>

<p class="para">She&rsquo;d got a reputation for being calm and capable in a crisis.</p>

<p class="para">Next thing she knew she&rsquo;d be making shortbread and apple pies as good as her mother&rsquo;s, and then there&rsquo;d be no hope for her.</p>

<p class="para">So she&rsquo;d introduced Perdita. She&rsquo;d heard somewhere that inside every fat woman was a thin woman trying to get out,<span class="footnoteRef"><a href="footnote.xhtml#ft3" id="ft_3">*</a></span> so she&rsquo;d named her Perdita. She was a good repository for all those thoughts that Agnes couldn&rsquo;t think on account of her wonderful personality. Perdita would use black writing paper if she could get away with it, and would be beautifully pale instead of embarrassingly flushed. Perdita wanted to be an interestingly lost soul in plum-<a id="page32"></a>colored lipstick. Just occasionally, though, Agnes thought Perdita was as dumb as she was.</p>

<p class="para">Was the only alternative the witches? She&rsquo;d felt their interest in her, in a way she couldn&rsquo;t exactly identify. It was of a piece with knowing when someone was watching you, although she had, in fact, occasionally seen Nanny Ogg watching her in a critical kind of fashion, like someone inspecting a second-hand horse.</p>

<p class="para">She knew she <span class="italic">did</span> have some talent. Sometimes she knew things that were going to happen, although always in a sufficiently confused way that the knowledge was totally useless until afterward. And there was her voice. She was aware it wasn&rsquo;t quite natural. She&rsquo;d always enjoyed singing and, somehow, her voice had just done everything she&rsquo;d wanted it to do.</p>

<p class="para">But she&rsquo;d seen the ways the witches lived. Oh, Nanny Ogg was all right&mdash;quite a nice old baggage really. But the others were weird, lying crosswise on the world instead of nicely parallel to it like everyone else&hellip;old Mother Dismass who could see into the past and the future but was totally blind in the present, and Millie Hopwood over in Slice, who stuttered and had runny ears, and as for Granny Weatherwax&hellip;</p>

<p class="para">Oh, <span class="italic">yes.</span> Finest job in the world? Being a sour old woman with no friends?</p>

<p class="para">They were always looking for weird people like themselves.</p>

<p class="para">Well, they could look in vain for Agnes Nitt.</p>

<p class="para">Fed up with living in Lancre, and fed up with the witches, and above all fed up with being Agnes Nitt, she&rsquo;d&hellip;escaped.</p>

<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent">Nanny Ogg didn&rsquo;t look built for running, but she covered the ground deceptively fast, her great heavy boots kicking up shoals of leaves.</p>

<p class="para">There was a trumpeting overhead. Another skein of geese passed across the sky, so fast in pursuit of the summer that their wings were hardly moving in the ballistic rush.</p>

<p class="para">Granny Weatherwax&rsquo;s cottage looked deserted. It had, Nanny felt, a particularly empty feel.</p>

<p class="para">She scurried around to the back door and burst through, pounded up the stairs, saw the gaunt figure on the bed, reached an instant conclusion, grabbed the pitcher of water from its place on the marble washstand, ran forward&hellip;</p>

<p class="para">A hand shot up and grabbed her wrist.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I <span class="italic">was</span> having a <span class="italic">nap</span>,&rdquo; said Granny, opening her eyes. &ldquo;Gytha, I swear I could feel you comin&rsquo; half a mile away&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;We got to make a cup of tea quick!&rdquo; gasped Nanny, almost sagging with relief.</p>

<p class="para">Granny Weatherwax was more than bright enough not to ask questions.</p>

<p class="para">But you couldn&rsquo;t hurry a good cup of tea. Nanny Ogg jiggled from one foot to the other while the fire was pumped up, the small frogs fished out of the water bucket, the water boiled, the dried leaves allowed to seep.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t saying nothing,&rdquo; said Nanny, sitting down at last. &ldquo;Just pour a cup, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">On the whole, witches despised fortune-telling from tea-leaves. Tea leaves are not uniquely fortunate in knowing what the future holds. They are really just <a id="page34"></a>something for the eyes to rest on while the mind does the work. Practically anything would do. The scum on a puddle, the skin on a custard&hellip;anything. Nanny Ogg could see the future in the froth on a beer mug. It invariably showed that she was going to enjoy a refreshing drink which she almost certainly was not going to pay for.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;You recall young Agnes Nitt?&rdquo; said Nanny as Granny Weatherwax tried to find the milk.</p>

<p class="para">Granny hesitated.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Agnes who calls herself Perditax?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Perdita X,&rdquo; said Nanny. She at least respected anyone&rsquo;s right to recreate themselves.</p>

<p class="para">Granny shrugged. &ldquo;Fat girl. Big hair. Walks with her feet turned out. Sings to herself in the woods. Good voice. Reads books. Says &lsquo;poot!&rsquo; instead of swearing. Blushes when anyone looks at her. Wears black lace gloves with the fingers cut out.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;You remember we once talked about maybe how possibly she might be&hellip;suitable.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s a twist in the soul there, you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Granny. &ldquo;But&hellip;it&rsquo;s an unfortunate name.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Her father&rsquo;s name was Terminal,&rdquo; said Nanny Ogg reflectively. &ldquo;There were three sons: Primal, Medial and Terminal. I&rsquo;m afraid the family&rsquo;s always had a problem with education.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I <span class="italic">meant</span> Agnes,&rdquo; said Granny. &ldquo;Always puts me in mind of carpet fluff, that name.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Prob&rsquo;ly that&rsquo;s why she called herself Perdita,&rdquo; said Nanny.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Got her fixed in your mind?&rdquo; said Nanny.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>
<a id="page35"></a>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Good. Now look at them tea leaves.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Granny looked down.</p>

<p class="para">There was no particular drama, perhaps because of the way Nanny had built up expectations. But Granny did hiss between her teeth.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Well, now. There&rsquo;s a thing,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;See it? See it?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Like&hellip;a skull?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;And them eyes? I nearly pi&mdash;I was pretty damn surprised by them eyes, I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Granny carefully replaced the cup.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Her mam showed me her letters home,&rdquo; said Nanny. &ldquo;I brung &rsquo;em with me. It&rsquo;s worrying, Esme. She could be facing something bad. She&rsquo;s a Lancre girl. One of ours. Nothing&rsquo;s too much trouble when it&rsquo;s one of your own, I always say.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Tea leaves can&rsquo;t tell the future,&rdquo; said Granny quietly. &ldquo;Everyone knows that.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Tea leaves don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Well, who&rsquo;d be so daft as to tell anything to a bunch of dried leaves?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Nanny Ogg looked down at Agnes&rsquo;s letters home. They were written in the careful rounded script of someone who&rsquo;d been taught to write as a child by copying letters on a slate, and had never written enough as an adult to change their style. The person writing them had also very conscientiously drawn faint pencil lines on the paper before writing.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s opera?&rdquo; said Granny Weatherwax.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like theater, with singing,&rdquo; said Nanny Ogg.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Hah! <span class="italic">Theater</span>,&rdquo; said Granny darkly.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Our Nev told me about it. It&rsquo;s all singing in foreign languages, he said. He couldn&rsquo;t understand any of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Granny put down the letters.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes, but your Nev can&rsquo;t understand a lot of things. What was he doing at this opera theater, anyway?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Nicking the lead off the roof.&rdquo; Nanny said this quite happily. It wasn&rsquo;t theft if an Ogg was doing it.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell much from the letters, except that <a id="page37"></a>she&rsquo;s picking up an education,&rdquo; said Granny. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a long way to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">There was a hesitant knock on the door. It was Shawn Ogg, Nanny&rsquo;s youngest son and Lancre&rsquo;s entire civil and public service. Currently he had his postman&rsquo;s badge on; the Lancre postal service consisted of taking the mailbag off the nail where the coach left it and delivering it to the outlying homesteads when he had a moment, although many citizens were in the habit of going down to the sack and rummaging until they found some mail they liked.</p>

<p class="para">He touched his helmet respectfully at Granny Weatherwax.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Got a lot of letters, mum,&rdquo; he said to Nanny Ogg. &ldquo;Er. They&rsquo;re all addressed to, er, well&hellip;er&hellip;you&rsquo;d better have a look, mum.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Nanny Ogg took the proffered bundle.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;&lsquo;The Lancre Witch,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said aloud.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;That&rsquo;d be me, then,&rdquo; said Granny Weatherwax firmly, and took the letters.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Ah. Well, I&rsquo;d better be going&hellip;&rdquo; said Nanny, backing toward the door.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t imagine why people&rsquo;d be writing to me,&rdquo; said Granny, slitting an envelope. &ldquo;Still, I suppose news gets around.&rdquo; She focused on the words.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;&lsquo;Dear Witch,&rsquo;&rdquo; she read, &ldquo;&lsquo;I would just like to say how much I appreciated the Famous Carrot and Oyster Pie recipe. My husband&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Nanny Ogg made it halfway down the path before her boots became, suddenly, too heavy to lift.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;<span class="italic">Gytha Ogg, you come back here right now!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<a id="page38"></a>

<p class="paraNoIndent">Agnes tried again. She didn&rsquo;t really know anyone in Ankh-Morpork and she did need someone to talk to, even if they didn&rsquo;t listen.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I suppose mainly I came because of the witches,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p class="para">Christine turned, her eyes wide with fascination. So was her mouth. It was like looking at a rather pretty bowling ball.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Witches?!&rdquo; she breathed.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Agnes wearily. Yes. People were always fascinated by the idea of witches. They should try living around them, she thought.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Do they do spells and ride around on broomsticks?!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;No wonder you ran away!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;What? Oh&hellip;no&hellip;it&rsquo;s not like that. I mean, they&rsquo;re not <span class="italic">bad</span>. It&rsquo;s much&hellip;worse than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Worse than bad?!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;They think they know what&rsquo;s best for everybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Christine&rsquo;s forehead wrinkled, as it tended to when she was contemplating a problem more complex than &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t sound very ba&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;They&hellip;mess people around. They think that just because they&rsquo;re right that&rsquo;s the same as good!

<p class="para">The force of the words knocked even Christine back. &ldquo;Oh, dear!! Did they want you to do something?!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;They want me to <span class="italic">be</span> something. But I&rsquo;m not going to!&rdquo;</p>
<a id="page39"></a>

<p class="para">Christine stared at her. And then, automatically, forgot everything she&rsquo;d just heard.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s have a look around!!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent">Nanny Ogg balanced on a chair and took down an oblong wrapped in paper.</p>

<p class="para">Granny watched sternly with her arms folded.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Thing is,&rdquo; Nanny babbled, under the laser glare, &ldquo;my late husband, I remember him once sayin&rsquo; to me, after dinner, he said, &lsquo;You know, mother, it&rsquo;d be a real shame if all the stuff you know just passed away when <span class="italic">you</span> did. Why don&rsquo;t you write some of it down?&rsquo; So I scribbled the odd one, when I had a moment, and then I thought it&rsquo;d be nice to have it all properly done so I sent it off to the Almanac people in Ankh-Morpork and they hardly charged me anything and a little while ago they sent me this, I think it&rsquo;s a very good job, it&rsquo;s amazing how they get all the letters so neat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;You done a <span class="italic">book</span>,&rdquo; said Granny.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Only cookery,&rdquo; said Nanny Ogg meekly, as one might plead a first offense.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;What do you know about it? You hardly ever do any cooking,&rdquo; said Granny.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I do specialities,&rdquo; said Nanny.</p>

<p class="para">Granny looked at the offending volume.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;<span class="italic">The Joye of Snacks</span>,&rdquo; she read out loud. &ldquo;&lsquo;Bye A Lancre Witch.&rsquo; Hah! Why dint you put your own name on it, eh? Books&rsquo;ve got to have a name on &rsquo;em so&rsquo;s everyone knows who&rsquo;s guilty.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my <span class="italic">gnome de plum</span>,&rdquo; said Nanny. &ldquo;Mr. Goatberger the Almanac man said it&rsquo;d make it sound more mysterious.&rdquo;</p>
<a id="page40"></a>

<p class="para">Granny cast her gimlet gaze to the bottom of the crowded cover, where it said, in very small lettering, &ldquo;CXXviith Printyng. More Than Twenty Thoufand Solde! One half dollar.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;You sent them some money to get it all printed?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Only a couple of dollars,&rdquo; said Nanny. &ldquo;Damn good job they made of it, too. And then they sent the money back afterward, only they got it wrong and sent three dollars extra.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Granny Weatherwax was grudgingly literate but keenly numerate. She assumed that anything written down was probably a lie, and that applied to numbers, too. Numbers were used only by people who wanted to put one over on you.</p>

<p class="para">Her lips moved silently as she thought about numbers.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, quietly. &ldquo;And that was it, was it? You never wrote to him again?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Not on your life. Three dollars, mind. I dint want him saying he wanted &rsquo;em back.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I can see that,&rdquo; said Granny, still dwelling in the world of numbers. She wondered how much it cost to do a book. It couldn&rsquo;t be a lot: they had sort of printing mills to do the actual work.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;After all, there&rsquo;s a lot you can do with three dollars,&rdquo; said Nanny.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Right enough,&rdquo; said Granny. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t got a pencil about you, have you? You being a literary type and all?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I got a slate,&rdquo; said Nanny.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Pass it over, then.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I bin keeping it by me in case I wake up in the night and I get an idea for a recipe, see,&rdquo; said Nanny.</p>
<a id="page41"></a>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Granny vaguely. The slate pencil squeaked across the gray tablet. <span class="italic">The paper must cost something. And you&rsquo;d probably have to tip someone a couple of pennies to sell it&hellip;</span> Angular figures danced from column to column.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make another cup of tea, shall I?&rdquo; said Nanny, relieved that the conversation appeared to be coming to a peaceful end.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; said Granny. She stared at the result and drew two lines under it. &ldquo;But you enjoyed it, did you?&rdquo; she called out. &ldquo;The writin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Nanny Ogg poked her head around the scullery door. &ldquo;Oh, yes. The money dint matter,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never been very good at numbers, have you?&rdquo; said Granny. Now she drew a circle around the final figure.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Oh, you know me, Esme,&rdquo; said Nanny cheerfully. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t subtract a fart from a plate of beans.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, &rsquo;cos I reckon this Master Goatberger owes you a bit more than you got, if there&rsquo;s any justice in the world,&rdquo; said Granny.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Money ain&rsquo;t everything, Esme. What I say is, if you&rsquo;ve got your health&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I reckon, if there&rsquo;s any justice, it&rsquo;s about four or five thousand dollars,&rdquo; said Granny quietly.</p>

<p class="para">There was a crash from the scullery.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s a good job the money don&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; Granny Weatherwax went on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be a terrible thing otherwise. All that money, matterin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Nanny Ogg&rsquo;s white face appeared around the edge of the door. &ldquo;He never!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Could be a bit more,&rdquo; said Granny.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;It never!&rdquo;</p>
<a id="page42"></a>

<p class="para">&ldquo;You just adds up and divides and that.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Nanny Ogg stared in horrified fascination at her own fingers.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s a&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped. The only word she could think of was &ldquo;fortune&rdquo; and that wasn&rsquo;t adequate. Witches didn&rsquo;t operate in a cash economy. The whole of the Ramtops, by and large, got by without the complications of capital. <span class="italic">Fifty</span> dollars was a fortune. A hundred dollars was a, was a, was&hellip;well, it was <span class="italic">two</span> fortunes, that was what it was.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lot of money,&rdquo; she said weakly. &ldquo;What couldn&rsquo;t I do with money like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Dunno,&rdquo; said Granny Weatherwax. &ldquo;What did you do with the three dollars?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Got it in a tin up the chimney,&rdquo; said Nanny Ogg.</p>

<p class="para">Granny nodded approvingly. This was the kind of good fiscal practice she liked to see.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Beats me why people&rsquo;d fall over themselves to read a cookery book, though,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;I mean, it&rsquo;s not the sort of thing that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">The room fell silent. Nanny Ogg shuffled her boots.</p>

<p class="para">Granny said, in a voice laden with a suspicion that was all the worse because it wasn&rsquo;t yet quite sure what it was suspicious of: &ldquo;It <span class="italic">is</span> a cookery book, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Nanny hurriedly, avoiding Granny&rsquo;s gaze. &ldquo;Yes. Recipes and that. Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Granny glared at her. &ldquo;<span class="italic">Just</span> recipes?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes. Oh, yes. Yes. And some&hellip;cookery anecdotes, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Granny went on glaring.</p>

<p class="para">Nanny gave in.</p>
<a id="page43"></a>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Er&hellip;look under Famous Carrot and Oyster Pie,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Page 25.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Granny turned the pages. Her lips moved silently. Then: &ldquo;I <span class="italic">see</span>. Anything else?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Er&hellip;Cinnamon and Marshmallow Fingers&hellip;page 17&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Granny looked it up.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;And?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Er&hellip;Celery Astonishment&hellip;page 10.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Granny looked <span class="italic">that</span> up, too.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say it astonished <span class="italic">me</span>,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Er&hellip;well, more or less all of Humorous Puddings and Cake Decoration. That&rsquo;s all of Chapter Six. I done illustrations for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Granny turned to Chapter Six. She had to turn the book around a couple of times.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;What one you looking at?&rdquo; said Nanny Ogg, because an author is always keen to get feedback.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Strawberry Wobbler,&rdquo; said Granny.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Ah. That one always gets a laugh.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">It did not appear to be obtaining one from Granny. She carefully closed the book.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Gytha,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this is <span class="italic">me</span> askin&rsquo; you this. Is there any page in this book, is there any single recipe, which does not in some way relate to&hellip;goings-on?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Nanny Ogg, her face red as her apples, seemed to give this some lengthy consideration.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Porridge,&rdquo; she said, eventually.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes. Er. No, I tell a lie, it&rsquo;s got my special honey mixture in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Granny turned a page.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;What about this one? Maids of Honor?&rdquo;</p>
<a id="page44"></a>

<p class="para">&ldquo;<span class="italic">Weeelll</span>, they starts <span class="italic">out</span> as Maids of Honor,&rdquo; said Nanny, fidgeting with her feet, &ldquo;but they ends up Tarts.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Granny looked at the front cover again. <span class="italic">The Joye of Snacks</span>.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;An&rsquo; you actually set out to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;It just sort of turned out that way, really.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Granny Weatherwax was not a jouster in the lists of love but, as an intelligent onlooker, she knew how the game was played. No wonder the book had sold like hot cakes. Half the recipes told you how to make them. It was surprising the pages hadn&rsquo;t singed.</p>

<p class="para">And it was by &ldquo;A Lancre Witch.&rdquo; The world was, Granny Weatherwax modestly admitted, well aware of who <span class="italic">the</span> witch of Lancre was; <span class="italic">viz</span>, it was her.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Gytha Ogg,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes, Esme?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Gytha Ogg, you look me in the eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Sorry, Esme.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;&lsquo;A Lancre Witch,&rsquo; it says here.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I never thought, Esme.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ll go and see Mr. Goatberger and have this stopped, right? I don&rsquo;t want people lookin&rsquo; at me and thinkin&rsquo; about the Bananana Soup Surprise.

And I ain&rsquo;t relishin&rsquo; going down the street and hearin&rsquo; people makin&rsquo; cracks about bananas.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes, Esme.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll come with you to make sure you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes, Esme.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll talk to the man about your money.&rdquo;</p>
<a id="page45"></a>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes, Esme.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;And we might just drop in on young Agnes to make sure she&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes, Esme.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll do it diplomatic like. We don&rsquo;t want people thinkin&rsquo; we&rsquo;re pokin&rsquo; our noses in.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes, Esme.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;No one could say I interfere where I&rsquo;m not wanted. You won&rsquo;t find anyone callin&rsquo; <span class="italic">me</span> a busybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes, Esme.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;That was, &lsquo;Yes, Esme, you won&rsquo;t find anyone callin&rsquo; <span class="italic">you</span> a busybody,&rsquo; was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Oh, yes, Esme.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;You sure about that?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes, Esme.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Granny looked out at the dull gray sky and the dying leaves and felt, amazingly enough, her sap rising. A day ago the future had looked aching and desolate, and now it looked full of surprises and terror and bad things happening to people&hellip;</p>

<p class="para">In the scullery, Nanny Ogg grinned to herself.</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent">Agnes had known a little bit about the theater. A traveling company came to Lancre sometimes. Their stage was about twice the size of a door, and &ldquo;backstage&rdquo; consisted of a bit of sacking behind which was usually a man trying to change trousers and wigs at the same time and another man, dressed as a king, having a surreptitious smoke.</p>
<a id="page46"></a>

<p class="para">The Opera House was almost as big as the Patrician&rsquo;s palace, and far more palatial. It covered three acres. There was stabling for twenty horses and two elephants in the cellar; Agnes spent some time there, because the elephants were reassuringly larger than her.</p>

<p class="para">There were rooms behind the stage so big that entire sets were stored there. There was a whole ballet school somewhere in the building. Some of the girls were on stage now, ugly in woolly jumpers, going through a routine.</p>

<p class="para">The inside of the Opera House&mdash;at least, the backstage inside&mdash;put Agnes strongly in mind of the clock her brother had taken apart to find the tick. It was hardly a building. It was more like a machine. Sets and curtains and ropes hung in the darkness like dreadful things in a forgotten cellar. The stage was only a small part of the place, a little rectangle of light in a huge, complicated darkness full of significant machinery&hellip;</p>

<p class="para">A piece of dust floated down from the blackness high above. She brushed it off.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I thought I heard someone up there,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably the Ghost!!&rdquo; said Christine. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got one, you know! Oh, I said <span class="italic">we</span>!! Isn&rsquo;t this exciting?!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;What? Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;The Ghost!!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Blast, thought Agnes. It was always ready to catch her out. Just when she thought she&rsquo;d put all that behind her. She&rsquo;d know things without quite <a id="page47"></a>knowing why. It upset people. It certainly upset her.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know! But they say if ever they sell seats in Box Eight there&rsquo;ll be a dreadful tragedy!! Isn&rsquo;t that romantic?!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">For some reason Agnes&rsquo;s practical eye was <a id="page48"></a>drawn to the huge chandelier that hung over the auditorium like a fantastic sea monster. Its thick rope disappeared into the darkness near the ceiling.</p>

<p class="para">The glass chimes tinkled.</p>

<p class="para">Another flare of that certain power which Agnes did her best to suppress at every turn flashed a treacherous image across her mind.</p>

<p class="para">The man with the sack coughed and regrouped. &ldquo;Like great holes, they were&mdash;&rdquo; he began, but it was clear that it had all been spoiled for him. &ldquo;Great holes,&rdquo; he said sourly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I saw. And no nose, I might add, thank you so very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Ghost again!&rdquo; said a scene-shifter.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;He jumped out from behind the organ,&rdquo; said Tommy Cripps. &ldquo;Next thing I knew, there was a rope around my neck and I was upside-down!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;What are you staring at, Mr. Pounder?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p class="para">The old man looked down. &ldquo;I knows what I saw, Mr. Salzella,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I see <span class="italic">lots</span> o&rsquo; things, I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;It was the Ghost!&rdquo; said Tommy, delighted to have center-stage again. &ldquo;He swooped out at me, Mr. Salzella! I think my leg is broken,&rdquo; he added quickly, in the voice of one who is suddenly aware of the time-off opportunities of the situation.</p>

<p class="para">Agnes expected the newcomer to say something like &ldquo;Ghosts? There&rsquo;s no such thing.&rdquo; He had the kind of <span class="italic">face</span> that said that.</p>

<p class="para">Salzella nodded. &ldquo;Yes, they do rather go through them at the toes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I mean, it&rsquo;s ridiculous! I&rsquo;ve still got a pair of boots belonging to my father!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;But ballet shoes, sir, are rather more like foot gloves,&rdquo; Salzella explained.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling me! They cost seven dollars a pair and they last hardly any time at all! A few performances! There must be some way we can make a saving&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Salzella gave his new employer a long, cool stare. &ldquo;Possibly we could ask the girls to spend more time in the air?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A few extra <span class="italic">grands jet&eacute;s</span>?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Bucket looked puzzled. &ldquo;Would that work?&rdquo; he said suspiciously.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Well, their feet wouldn&rsquo;t be on the ground for so long, would they?&rdquo; said Salzella, in the tones of one who knows for a fact that he&rsquo;s much more intelligent than anyone else in the room.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Good point. Good point. Have a word with the ballet mistress, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<a id="page61"></a>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Of course. I am sure she will welcome the suggestion. You may well have halved costs at a stroke.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Bucket beamed.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Which is perhaps just as well,&rdquo; said Salzella. &ldquo;There is, in fact, another matter that I&rsquo;ve come to see you about&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;It is to do with the organ we had.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Had? What do you mean, <span class="italic">had</span>?&rdquo; said Bucket, adding, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to tell me something expensive, are you? What have we got now?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;A lot of pipes and some keyboards,&rdquo; said Salzella. &ldquo;Everything else has been smashed.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Smashed? Who by?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Salzella leaned back. He was not a man to whom amusement came easily, but he realized that he was rather enjoying this.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when Mr. Pnigeus and Mr. Cavaille sold you this Opera House, did they mention anything&hellip;supernatural?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Bucket scratched his head. &ldquo;Well&hellip;yes. After I&rsquo;d signed and paid. It was a bit of a joke. They said: &lsquo;Oh, and by the way, people say there&rsquo;s some man in evening dress who haunts the place, haha, ridiculous, isn&rsquo;t it, these theatrical people, like children really, haha, but you may find it keeps them happy if you always keep Box Eight free on first nights, haha.&rsquo; I remember that quite well. Handing over thirty thousand dollars concentrates the memory a bit. And then they rode off. Quite a fast carriage, now I come to think about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Salzella, and he almost smiled. &ldquo;Well, now that the ink is dry, I wonder if I might fill you in on the fine detail&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Bucket said. &ldquo;Let me see if I&rsquo;ve got this right. There&rsquo;s this Ghost. Every time anyone loses a hammer in this place, it&rsquo;s been stolen by the Ghost. Every time someone cracks a note, it&rsquo;s because of the Ghost. But <span class="italic">also</span>, every time someone <span class="italic">finds</span> a lost object, it&rsquo;s because of the Ghost. Every time someone has a very good scene, it must be because of the Ghost. He sort of comes with the building, like the rats. Every so often someone sees him, but not for long because he comes and goes like a&hellip;well, a Ghost. Apparently we let him use Box Eight for <span class="italic">free</span> on every first-night performance. And you say people <span class="italic">like</span> him?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;&lsquo;Like&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t quite the right word,&rdquo; said Salzella. &ldquo;It would be more correct to say that&hellip;well, it&rsquo;s pure superstition, of course, but they think he&rsquo;s lucky. <span class="italic">Thought</span> he was, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para"><span class="italic">And you wouldn&rsquo;t understand a thing about that, would you, you coarse little cheesemonger</span>, he <a id="page65"></a>added to himself. <span class="italic">Cheese is cheese.

<p class="para">&ldquo;Lucky,&rdquo; said Bucket flatly.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Luck is very important,&rdquo; said Salzella, in a voice in which pained patience floated like ice cubes. &ldquo;I imagine that temperament is not an important factor in the cheese business?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;We rely on rennet,&rdquo; said Bucket.</p>

<p class="para">Salzella sighed. &ldquo;Anyway, the company feel that the Ghost is&hellip;lucky. He used to send people little notes of encouragement. After a really good performance, sopranos would find a box of chocolates in their dressing room, that sort of thing. And dead flowers, for some reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;<span class="italic">Dead</span> flowers?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Well, not flowers at all, as such. Just a bouquet of dead rose-stems with no roses on them. It&rsquo;s something of a trademark of his. It&rsquo;s considered lucky.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Dead flowers are lucky?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Possibly. Live flowers, certainly, are terribly bad luck on stage. Some singers won&rsquo;t even have them in their dressing room.

Until about six months ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Mr. Bucket shut his eyes again. &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p class="para">Salzella sighed.</p>

<p class="para">Bucket took offense at the sigh. &ldquo;I happen to pride myself that I am a good judge of character,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Look a man deeply in the eye and give him a firm handshake and you know everything about him.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Seldom Bucket did his best. &ldquo;Well, I know there&rsquo;s a dreadful bend in the road up by&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;A catastrophe curve, Mr. Bucket, is what opera runs along. Opera happens because a large number of things amazingly fail to go wrong, Mr. Bucket.

<p class="para">&ldquo;Oh, <span class="italic">theater</span>,&rdquo; said Salzella. &ldquo;Theater doesn&rsquo;t even approach it. Opera isn&rsquo;t theater with singing and dancing. Opera&rsquo;s <span class="italic">opera</span>. You might think a production like <span class="italic">Lohenshaak</span> is full of passion, but it&rsquo;s a sandpit of toddlers compared to what goes on behind the scenes. The singers all loathe the sight of one another, the chorus despises the singers, they both hate the orchestra, and everyone fears <a id="page74"></a>the conductor; the staff on one prompt side won&rsquo;t talk to the staff on the opposite prompt side, the dancers are all crazed from hunger in any case, and that&rsquo;s only the start of it, because what is really&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">There was a series of knocks at the door. They were painfully irregular, as if the knocker were having to concentrate quite hard.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Come in, Walter,&rdquo; said Salzella.</p>

<p class="para">Walter Plinge shuffled in, a pail dangling at the end of each arm. &ldquo;Come to fill your coal scuttle Mr. Bucket!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Bucket waved a hand vaguely, and turned back to the director of music. &ldquo;You were saying?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Salzella stared at Walter as the man carefully piled lumps of coal in the scuttle, one at a time.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Salzella?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;What? Oh. I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;what was I saying?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Something about it being only the start?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;What? Oh. Yes. Yes&hellip;you see, it&rsquo;s fine for actors. There&rsquo;s plenty of parts for old men. Acting&rsquo;s something you can do all your life. You get <span class="italic">better</span> at it. But when your talent is singing or dancing&hellip;Time creeps up behind you, all the&hellip;&rdquo; He fumbled for a word, and settled lamely for &ldquo;Time. Time is the poison. You watch backstage one night and you&rsquo;ll see the dancers checking all the time in any mirror they can find for that first little imperfection. You watch the singers. Everyone&rsquo;s on edge, everyone knows that this might be their last perfect night, that tomorrow might be the beginning of the end. That&rsquo;s why everyone worries about luck, you see? All the stuff about live flowers being unlucky, you remember? Well, so&rsquo;s green. And real jewelry <a id="page75"></a>worn onstage. And real mirrors on stage. And whistling onstage. And peeking at the audience through the main curtains. And using new makeup on a first night. And knitting onstage, even at rehearsals. A yellow clarinet in the orchestra is very unlucky, don&rsquo;t ask me why. And as for stopping a performance before its proper ending, well, that&rsquo;s worst of all. You might as well sit under a ladder and break mirrors.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Behind Salzella, Walter carefully placed the last lump of coal on the pile in the scuttle and dusted it carefully.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Good grief,&rdquo; said Bucket, at last. &ldquo;I thought it was tough in cheese.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">He waved a hand at the pile of papers and what passed for the accounts. &ldquo;I paid thirty thousand for this place,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the center of the city! Prime site! I thought it was hard bargaining!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;They&rsquo;d have probably accepted twenty-five.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;And tell me again about Box Eight. You let this Ghost have it?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;The Ghost considers it is his for every first night, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;How does he get in?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;No one knows. We&rsquo;ve searched and searched for secret entrances&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;He really doesn&rsquo;t pay?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth fifty dollars a night!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;There will be trouble if you sell it,&rdquo; said Salzella.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Good grief, Salzella, you&rsquo;re an educated man! How can you sit there so calmly and accept this sort of madness? Some creature in a mask has the run of <a id="page76"></a>the place, gets a prime Box all to himself, kills people, and you sit there saying there will be trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I told you: the show must go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;<span class="italic">Why?</span> We never said &lsquo;the cheese must go on&rsquo;! What&rsquo;s so special about the show going on?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Salzella smiled. &ldquo;As far as I understand it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the&hellip;power behind the show, the soul of the show, all the effort that&rsquo;s gone into it, call it what you will&hellip;it leaks out and spills everywhere. That&rsquo;s why they burble about &lsquo;the show must go on.&rsquo; It <span class="italic">must</span> go on. But most of the company wouldn&rsquo;t even understand why anyone should ask the question.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Bucket glared at the pile of what passed for the Opera House&rsquo;s financial records.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;They certainly don&rsquo;t understand bookkeeping! Who does the accounts?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;All of us, really,&rdquo; said Salzella.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;<span class="italic">All</span> of you?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Money gets put in, money gets taken out&hellip;&rdquo; said Salzella vaguely. &ldquo;Is it important?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Bucket&rsquo;s jaw dropped. &ldquo;Is it <span class="italic">important</span>?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; Salzella went on, smoothly, &ldquo;opera doesn&rsquo;t make money. Opera never makes money.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Good grief, man! <span class="italic">Important</span>? What&rsquo;d I ever have achieved in the cheese business, I&rsquo;d like to know, if I&rsquo;d said that money wasn&rsquo;t important?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Salzella smiled humorlessly. &ldquo;There are people out on the stage right now, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who&rsquo;d say that you would probably have made better cheeses.&rdquo; He sighed, and leaned over the desk. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;cheese <span class="italic">does</span> make money. And opera <span class="italic">doesn&rsquo;t</span>. Opera&rsquo;s what you spend money <span class="italic">on</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;But&hellip;what do you get out of it?&rdquo;</p>
<a id="page77"></a>

<p class="para">&ldquo;You get opera. You put money in, you see, and opera comes out,&rdquo; said Salzella wearily.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no <span class="italic">profit</span>?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Profit&hellip;profit,&rdquo; murmured the director of music, scratching his forehead. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve come across the word.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Then how do we manage?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;We seem to rub along.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Bucket put his head in his hands. &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; he muttered, half to himself, &ldquo;I knew the place wasn&rsquo;t making much, but I thought that was just because it was run badly. We have big audiences! We charge a mint for tickets! Now I&rsquo;m told that a Ghost runs around killing people and we don&rsquo;t even make any money!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Salzella beamed. &ldquo;Ah, <span class="italic">opera</span>,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent">Greebo stalked over the inn&rsquo;s rooftops.</p>

<p class="para">Most cats are nervous and ill at ease when taken out of their territory, which is why cat books go on about putting butter on their paws and so on, presumably because constantly skidding into the walls will take the animal&rsquo;s mind off where the walls actually <span class="italic">are</span>.</p>

<p class="para">But Greebo traveled well, purely because he took it for granted that the whole world was his dirt box.</p>

<p class="para">He dropped heavily onto an outhouse roof and padded toward a small open window.</p>

<p class="para">Greebo also had a cat&rsquo;s approach to possessions, which was simply that nothing edible had a right to belong to other people.</p>

<p class="para">From the window came a variety of smells which <a id="page78"></a>included pork pies and cream. He squeezed through and dropped onto the pantry shelf.</p>

<p class="para">Of course, sometimes he got caught. At least, sometimes he got <span class="italic">discovered&hellip;</span></p>

<p class="para">There <span class="italic">was</span> cream. He settled down.</p>

<p class="para">He was halfway down the bowl when the door opened.</p>

<p class="para">Greebo&rsquo;s ears flattened. His one good eye sought desperately for an escape route. The window was too high, the person opening the door was wearing a long dress that militated against the old &ldquo;through the legs&rdquo; routine and&hellip;and&hellip;and&hellip;<span class="italic">there was no escape&hellip;</span></p>

<p class="para">His claws scrabbled on the floor&hellip;</p>

<p class="para">Oh no&hellip;<span class="italic">here it came&hellip;</span></p>

<p class="para">Something flipped in his body&rsquo;s morphogenic field. Here was a problem a cat shape couldn&rsquo;t deal with. Oh, well, we know another one. Sometimes Greebo could be almost&hellip;human.</p>

<p class="para">Crockery crashed around him. Shelves erupted as his head rose. A bag of flour exploded outward to make room for his broadening shoulders.</p>

<p class="para">The cook stared up at him. Then she looked down. And then up. And then, her gaze dragged as though it were on a winch, down again.</p>

<p class="para">She screamed.</p>

<p class="para">Greebo screamed.</p>

<p class="para">He grabbed desperately at a bowl to cover that part which, as a cat, he never had to worry about exposing.</p>

<p class="para">He screamed again, this time because he&rsquo;d just poured lukewarm pork dripping all over himself.</p>

<p class="para">His groping fingers found a large copper jelly mold. Clasping it to his groinal areas, he barreled <a id="page79"></a>forward and fled out of the pantry and out of the kitchen and out of the dining room and out of the inn and into the night.</p>

<p class="para">The spy, who was dining with the traveling salesman, put down his knife.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s something you don&rsquo;t often see,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said the salesman, who&rsquo;d had his back to the excitement.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;One of those old copper jelly molds. They&rsquo;re worth quite a lot now. My aunt had a very good one.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">The hysterical cook was given a big drink and several members of staff went out into the darkness to investigate.</p>

<p class="para">All they found was a jelly mold, lying forlornly in the yard.</p>

<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent">At home Granny Weatherwax slept with open windows and an unlocked door, secure in the knowledge that the Ramtops&rsquo; various creatures of the night would rather eat their own ears than break in. In dangerously civilized lands, however, she took a different view.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t think we <span class="italic">need</span> to shove the bed in front of the door, Esme,&rdquo; said Nanny Ogg, heaving on her end.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be too careful,&rdquo; said Granny. &ldquo;Supposing some man started rattlin&rsquo; the knob in the middle of the night?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Not at our time of life,&rdquo; said Nanny sadly.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Gytha Ogg, you are the most&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Granny was interrupted by a watery sound. It came from behind the wall and went on for some time.</p>
<a id="page80"></a>

<p class="para">It stopped, and then started again&mdash;a steady splashing that gradually became a trickle. Nanny started to grin.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Someone fillin&rsquo; a bath?&rdquo; said Granny.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;&hellip;or I suppose it could be someone fillin&rsquo; a bath,&rdquo; Nanny conceded.</p>

<p class="para">There was the sound of a third jug being emptied. Footsteps left the room. A few seconds later a door opened and there was a rather heavier tread, followed after a brief interval by a few splashes and a grunt.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes, a man gettin&rsquo; into a bath,&rdquo; said Granny. &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you doin&rsquo;, Gytha?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Seein&rsquo; if there&rsquo;s a knothole in this wood somewhere,&rdquo; said Nanny. &ldquo;Ah, here&rsquo;s one&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Come back here!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Sorry, Esme.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">And then the singing started. It was a very pleasant tenor voice, given added timbre by the bath itself.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Show me the way to go home, I&rsquo;m tired and I want to go to bed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s enjoyin&rsquo; themselves, anyway,&rdquo; said Nanny.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;&mdash;wherever I may roam&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">There was a knock at the distant bathroom door, upon which the singer slipped smoothly into another language:</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;<span class="italic">&mdash;per via di terra, mare o schiuma&mdash;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">The witches looked at one another.</p>

<p class="para">A muffled voice said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought you your hot-water bottle, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Thank you verr&rsquo; mucha,&rdquo; said the bather, his voice dripping with accent.</p>
<a id="page81"></a>

<p class="para">Footsteps went away in the distance.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Well, well, well,&rdquo; said Granny, more or less to herself. &ldquo;It seems once again that our Mr. Slugg is a secret polyglot.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Gytha, is there anything in the whole world you can&rsquo;t make sound grubby?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Not found it yet, Esme,&rdquo; said Nanny brightly.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I <span class="italic">meant</span> that when he mutters in his sleep and sings in his bath he talks just like us, but when he thinks people are listening he comes over all foreign.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably to throw that Basilica person off the scent,&rdquo; Nanny said.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Oh, I reckon Mr. Basilica is very close to Henry Slugg,&rdquo; said Granny. &ldquo;In fact, I reckon that they&rsquo;re one and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">There was a gentle knock at the door.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; Granny demanded.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, ma&rsquo;am. Mr. Slot. This is my tavern.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">The witches pushed the bed aside and Granny opened the door a fraction.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she said suspiciously.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Er&hellip;the coachman said you were&hellip;witches?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Maybe you could&hellip;help us?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my boy&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Granny opened the door farther and saw the woman standing behind Mr. Slot. One look at her <a id="page82"></a>face was enough. There was a bundle in her arms.</p>

<p class="para">Granny stepped back. &ldquo;Bring him in and let me have a look at him.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">She took the baby from the woman, sat down on the room&rsquo;s one chair, and pulled back the blanket. Nanny Ogg peered over her shoulder.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; said Granny, after a while. She glanced at Nanny, who gave an almost imperceptible shake of her head.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a curse on this house, that&rsquo;s what it is,&rdquo; said Slot. &ldquo;My best cow&rsquo;s been taken mortally sick, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Oh? You have a cowshed?&rdquo; said Granny. &ldquo;Very good place for a sickroom, a cowshed. It&rsquo;s the warmth. You better show me where it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;You want to take the boy down there?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">The man looked at his wife, and shrugged. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure you know your business best,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">He led the witches down some back stairs and across a yard and into the fetid sweet air of the byre. A cow was stretched out on the straw. It rolled an eye madly as they entered, and tried to moo.</p>

<p class="para">Granny took in the scene and stood looking thoughtful for a moment.</p>

<p class="para">Then she said, &ldquo;This will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;What do you need?&rdquo; said Slot.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Just peace and quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">The man scratched his head. &ldquo;I thought you did a chant or made up some potion or something,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I mean, I know where there&rsquo;s a toad&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<a id="page83"></a>

<p class="para">&ldquo;All I shall require is a candle,&rdquo; said Granny. &ldquo;A new one, for preference.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Mr. Slot looked a little put out. Despite his distraction, something about his manner suggested that Granny Weatherwax was possibly not that much of a witch if she didn&rsquo;t want a toad.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;And some matches,&rdquo; said Granny, noting this. &ldquo;A pack of cards might be useful, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll need three cold lamb chops and exactly two pints of beer,&rdquo; said Nanny Ogg.</p>

<p class="para">The man nodded. This didn&rsquo;t sound too toadlike, but it was better than nothing.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;What&rsquo;d you ask for that for?&rdquo; hissed Granny, as the man bustled off. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t imagine what good those&rsquo;d do! Anyway, you already had a big dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m always prepared to go that extra meal. You won&rsquo;t want me around and I&rsquo;ll get bored,&rdquo; said Nanny.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Did I say I didn&rsquo;t want you around?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Well&hellip;even I can see that boy is in a coma, and the cow has the Red Bugge if I&rsquo;m any judge. That&rsquo;s bad, too. So I reckon you&rsquo;re planning some&hellip;direct action.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Granny shrugged.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Time like that, a witch needs to be alone,&rdquo; said Nanny. &ldquo;But you just mind what you&rsquo;re doing, Esme Weatherwax.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">The child was brought down in a blanket and made as comfortable as possible. The man followed behind his wife with a tray.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Mrs. Ogg will do her necessary procedures with the tray in her room,&rdquo; said Granny haughtily. &ldquo;You <a id="page84"></a>just leave me in here tonight. And no one is to come in, right? No matter what.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">The mother gave a worried curtsy. &ldquo;But I thought I might look in about midn&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;No one. Now, off you go.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">When they&rsquo;d been gently but firmly ushered out, Nanny Ogg stuck her head around the door. &ldquo;What <span class="italic">exactly</span> are you planning, Esme?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve sat up with the dyin&rsquo; often enough, Gytha.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Enjoy your supper, Gytha.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Granny closed the door.</p>

<p class="para">She spent some time arranging boxes and barrels so that she had a crude table and something to sit on. The air was warm and smelled of bovine flatulence. Periodically she checked the health of both patients, although there was little enough to check.</p>

<p class="para">In the distance the sounds of the inn gradually subsided. The last one was the clink of the innkeeper&rsquo;s keys as he locked the doors. Granny heard him walk across to the cowshed door and hesitate. Then he went away, and began to climb the stairs.</p>

<p class="para">She waited a little longer and then lit the candle. Its cheery flame gave the place a warm and comforting glow.</p>

<p class="para">On the plank table she laid out the cards and attempted to play Patience, a game she&rsquo;d never been able to master.</p>

<p class="para">The candle burned down. She pushed the cards away, and sat watching the flame.</p>

<p class="para">After some immeasurable piece of time the <a id="page85"></a>flame flickered. It would have passed unnoticed by anyone who hadn&rsquo;t been concentrating on it for some while.</p>

<p class="para">She took a deep breath and&mdash;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said Granny Weatherwax.</p>

<p class="para">G<span class="smallCaps">OOD MORNING</span>, said a voice by her ear.</p>

<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent">Nanny Ogg had long ago polished off the chops and the beer, but she hadn&rsquo;t got into bed. She lay on it, fully clothed, with her arms behind her head, staring at the dark ceiling.</p>

<p class="para">After a while there was a scratching on the shutters. She got up and opened them.</p>

<p class="para">A huge figure leapt into the room. For a moment the moonlight lit a glistening torso and a mane of black hair. Then the creature dived under the bed.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Oh, deary deary me,&rdquo; said Nanny.</p>

<p class="para">She waited for a while, and then fished a chop bone off her tray. There was still a bit of meat on it. She lowered it toward the floor.</p>

<p class="para">A hand shot out and grabbed it.</p>

<p class="para">Nanny sat back.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Poor little man,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p class="para">It was only on the subject of Greebo that Nanny&rsquo;s otherwise keen sense of reality found itself all twisted. To Nanny Ogg he was merely a larger version of the little fluffy kitten he had once been. To everyone else he was a scarred ball of inventive malignancy.</p>

<p class="para">But now he had to deal with a problem seldom encountered by cats. The witches had, a year ago, turned him into a human, for reasons that had seemed quite necessary at the time. It had taken a <a id="page86"></a>lot of effort, and his morphogenic field had reasserted itself after a few hours, much to everyone&rsquo;s relief.</p>

<p class="para">But magic is never as simple as people think. It has to obey certain universal laws. And one is that, no matter how hard a thing is to do, once it <span class="italic">has</span> been done it&rsquo;ll become a whole lot easier and will therefore be done a lot. A huge mountain might be scaled by strong men only after many centuries of failed attempts, but a few decades later grandmothers will be strolling up it for tea and then wandering back afterward to see where they left their glasses.</p>

<p class="para">In accordance with this law, Greebo&rsquo;s soul had noted that there was one extra option for use in a tight corner (in addition to the usual cat assortment of run, fight, crap or all three together) and that was: Become Human.</p>

<p class="para">It tended to wear off after a short time, most of which he spent searching desperately for a pair of pants.</p>

<p class="para">There were snores from under the bed. Gradually, to Nanny&rsquo;s relief, they turned into a purr.</p>

<p class="para">Then she sat bolt upright. She was some way from the cowshed but&hellip;</p>

<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent">Agnes stayed up late, simply because of the novelty. Most people in Lancre, as the saying goes, went to bed with the chickens and got up with the cows.<span class="footnoteRef"><a href="footnote.xhtml#ft4" id="ft_4">*</a></span> But she watched the evening&rsquo;s performance, and watched the set being struck afterwards, and watched the actors leave or, in the case of younger chorus members, head off for their lodgings in odd corners of the building. And then there was no one else, except Walter Plinge and his mother sweeping up.</p>

<p class="para">She headed for the staircase. There didn&rsquo;t seem to be a candle anywhere back here, but the few left burning in the auditorium were just enough to give the darkness a few shades.</p>

<p class="para">The stairs went up the wall at the rear of the stage, with nothing but a rickety handrail between them and the drop. Besides leading to the attics and storeroom on the upper floors, they were also one route to the fly loft and the other secret platforms where men in flat hats and gray overalls worked the magic of the theater, usually by means of pulleys&mdash;</p>

<p class="para">There was a figure on one of the gantries over <a id="page92"></a>the stage. Agnes saw it only because it moved slightly. It was kneeling down, looking at something. In the darkness.</p>

<p class="para">She stepped back. The stair creaked.</p>

<p class="para">The figure jerked around. A square of yellow light opened in the darkness, its beam pinning her against the brickwork.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; she said, raising a hand to shade her eyes.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s <span class="italic">that</span>?&rdquo; said a voice. And then, after a moment, &ldquo;Oh. It&rsquo;s&hellip;Perdita, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">The square of light swung toward her as the figure made its way over the stage.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Andr&eacute;?&rdquo; she said. She felt inclined to back away, if only the brickwork would let her.</p>

<p class="para">And suddenly he was on the stairs, quite an ordinary person, no shadow at all, holding a very large lantern.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; said the organist.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I&hellip;was just going to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo; He relaxed a little. &ldquo;Some of you girls have got rooms here. The management thought it was safer than having you going home alone late at night.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;What are you doing up here?&rdquo; said Agnes, suddenly aware that there was just the two of them.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I was&hellip;looking at the place where the Ghost tried to strangle Mr. Cripps,&rdquo; said Andr&eacute;.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I wanted to make certain everything was safe now, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t the stagehands do that?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Oh, you know them. I just thought I&rsquo;d better make certain.&rdquo;</p>
<a id="page93"></a>

<p class="para">Agnes looked down at the lantern.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen one like that before. How did you make it light up so quickly?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Er. It&rsquo;s a dark lantern. There&rsquo;s this flap, you see,&rdquo; he demonstrated, &ldquo;so you can shut it right down and open it up again&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;That must be very useful when you&rsquo;re looking for the black notes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sarcastic. I just don&rsquo;t want there to be any more trouble. You&rsquo;ll find that <span class="italic">you</span> start looking around when&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;<span class="italic">Goodnight</span>, Andr&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Goodnight, then.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">She hurried up the rest of the flights and ducked into her bedroom. No one followed her.</p>

<p class="para">When she&rsquo;d calmed down, which took some time, she undressed in the voluminous tent of her red flannel nightdress and got into bed, resisting any temptation to pull the covers over her head.</p>

<p class="para">She stared at the dark ceiling.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s stupid,&rdquo; she thought, eventually. &ldquo;He was on the stage this morning. <span class="italic">No one</span> could move that fast&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">She never knew whether she actually got some sleep or whether it happened just as she was dozing off, but there was a very faint knock at the door.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Perdita!?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Only one person she knew could exclaim a whisper.</p>

<p class="para">Agnes got up and padded over to the door. She opened the door a fraction, just to check, and Christine half-fell into the room.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m frightened!!&rdquo;</p>
<a id="page94"></a>

<p class="para">&ldquo;What of?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;The mirror!! It&rsquo;s <span class="italic">talking</span> to me!! Can I sleep in your room?!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Agnes looked around. It was crowded enough with the two of them standing up in it.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;The mirror&rsquo;s <span class="italic">talking</span>?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes!!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Christine dived into Agnes&rsquo;s bed and pulled the covers over her. &ldquo;Yes!!&rdquo; she said, indistinctly.</p>

<p class="para">Agnes stood alone in the darkness.</p>

<p class="para">People always tended to assume that she could cope, as if capability went with mass, like gravity. And merely saying briskly, &ldquo;Nonsense, mirrors don&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; would probably not be any help, especially with one half of the dialogue buried beneath the bedclothes.</p>

<p class="para">She felt her way into the next room, stubbing her foot on the bed in the darkness.</p>

<p class="para">There must be a candle in here, somewhere. She felt for the tiny bedside table, hoping to start the reassuring rattle of a matchbox.</p>

<p class="para">A faint glimmer from the midnight city filtered through the window. The mirror seemed to glow.</p>

<p class="para">She sat down on the bed, which creaked ominously under her.</p>

<p class="para">Oh well&hellip;one bed was as good as another&hellip;</p>

<p class="para">She was about to lie back when something in the darkness went:&hellip;<span class="italic">ting</span>.</p>

<p class="para">It was a tuning fork.</p>

<p class="para">And a voice said: &ldquo;Christine&hellip;please attend.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">She sat upright, staring at the darkness.</p>

<p class="para">And then realization dawned. No men, they&rsquo;d said. They&rsquo;d been very strict about that, as if opera <a id="page95"></a>were some kind of religion. It was not a problem in Agnes&rsquo;s case, at least in the way they meant, but for someone like Christine&hellip;They said love always found a way and, of course, so did a number of associated activities.</p>

<p class="para">Oh, good grief. She felt the blush start. In darkness! What kind of a reaction was that?</p>

<p class="para">Agnes&rsquo;s life unrolled in front of her. It didn&rsquo;t look as though it were going to have many high points. But it did hold years and years of being capable and having a lovely personality. It almost certainly held chocolate rather than sex and, while Agnes was not in a position to make a direct comparison, and regardless of the fact that a bar of chocolate could be made to last all day, it did not seem a very fair exchange.</p>

<p class="para">She felt the same feeling she&rsquo;d felt back home. Sometimes life reaches that desperate point where the wrong thing to do has to be the right thing to do.</p>

<p class="para">It doesn&rsquo;t matter what direction you go. Sometimes you just have to <span class="italic">go</span>.</p>

<p class="para">She gripped the bedclothes and replayed in her mind the way her friend spoke. You had to have that little gulp, that breathless tinkle in the tone that people got whose minds played with the fairies half the time. She tried it out in her head, and then delivered it to her vocal cords.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes?! Who&rsquo;s there?!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;A friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Agnes pulled the bedclothes up higher. &ldquo;In the middle of the <span class="italic">night</span>?!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Night is nothing to me. I belong to the night. And I can help you.&rdquo; It was a pleasant voice. It seemed to be coming from the mirror.</p>
<a id="page96"></a>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Help me to do what?!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to be the best singer in the opera?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Oh, Perdita is a <span class="italic">lot</span> better than me!!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">There was silence for a moment, and then the voice said: &ldquo;But while I cannot teach her to look and move like you, I can teach you to sing like her.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Agnes stared into the darkness, shock and humiliation rising from her like steam.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Tomorrow you will sing the part of Iodine. But I will teach you how to sing it <span class="italic">perfectly&hellip;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent">Next morning the witches had the interior of the coach almost to themselves. News like Greebo gets around. But Henry Slugg was there, if that was indeed his name, sitting next to a very welldressed, thin little man.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Well, here we are again, then,&rdquo; said Nanny Ogg.</p>

<p class="para">Henry smiled nervously.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;That was some good singing last night,&rdquo; Nanny went on.</p>

<p class="para">Henry&rsquo;s face set in a good-natured grimace. In his eyes, terror waved a white flag.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I am afraid Se&ntilde;or Basilica doesn&rsquo;t speak Morporkian, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the thin man. &ldquo;But I will translate for you, if you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Nanny. &ldquo;Then how come&mdash;<span class="italic">Ow</span>!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; said Granny Weatherwax. &ldquo;My elbow must have slipped.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Nanny Ogg rubbed her side. &ldquo;I was <span class="italic">saying</span>,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that he was&mdash;<span class="italic">Ow</span>!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Dear me, I seem to have done it again,&rdquo; said Granny. &ldquo;This gentleman was telling us that his <a id="page97"></a>friend <span class="italic">doesn&rsquo;t speak our language</span>, Gytha.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Eh? But&mdash;What? Oh. But&mdash;Ah. Really? Oh. All right,&rdquo; said Nanny. &ldquo;Oh, yes. Eats our pies, though, when&mdash;<span class="italic">Ow</span>!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Excuse my friend, it&rsquo;s her time of life. She gets confused,&rdquo; said Granny. &ldquo;We did enjoy his singing. Heard him through the wall.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;You were very fortunate,&rdquo; said the thin man primly. &ldquo;Sometimes people have to wait years to hear Se&ntilde;or Basilica&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;&mdash;probably waiting for him to finish his dinner&mdash;&rdquo; a voice muttered.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;&mdash;in fact, at La Scalda in Genua last month his singing made ten thousand people shed tears.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;&mdash;hah, I can do <span class="italic">that</span>, I don&rsquo;t see there&rsquo;s anything special about <span class="italic">that</span>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Granny&rsquo;s eyes hadn&rsquo;t left Henry &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Basilica&rdquo; Slugg&rsquo;s face. He had the expression of a man whose profound relief was horribly tempered by a dread that it wouldn&rsquo;t last very long.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Basilica&rsquo;s fame has spread far and wide,&rdquo; said the manager primly.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;&mdash;just like Senior Basilica,&rdquo; muttered Nanny. &ldquo;On other people&rsquo;s pies, I expect. Oh, yes, too posh for us now, just because he&rsquo;s the only man you could find on an atlas&mdash;<span class="italic">Ow</span>!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Granny, smiling in a way that everyone except Nanny Ogg would think of as innocent. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice and warm in Genua. I expect Se&ntilde;or Basilica really misses his home. And what do you do, young sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I am his manager and translator. Er. You have the advantage of me, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes, indeed.&rdquo; Granny nodded.</p>
<a id="page98"></a>

<p class="para">&ldquo;We have some good singers where we come from, too,&rdquo; said Nanny Ogg, rebelliously.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said the manager. &ldquo;And where do you ladies come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Lancre.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">The man politely endeavored to position Lancre on his mental map of great centers of music. &ldquo;Do you have a conservatory there?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said Nanny Ogg stoutly, and then, just to make sure, she added, &ldquo;You should see the size of my tomatoes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Granny rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Gytha, you <span class="italic">haven&rsquo;t</span> got a conservatory. It&rsquo;s just a big windowsill.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes, but it catches the sun nearly all day&mdash;<span class="italic">Ow&hellip;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I expect Se&ntilde;or Basilica is going to Ankh-Morpork?&rdquo; said Granny.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;We,&rdquo; said the manager, primly, &ldquo;have allowed the Opera House to engage us for the rest of the season&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">His voice faltered. He&rsquo;d looked up at the luggage rack. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s <span class="italic">that</span>?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Granny glanced up. &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s Greebo,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;And Mister Basilica&rsquo;s not to eat him,&rdquo; said Nanny.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;What <span class="italic">is</span> it?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a cat.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s <span class="italic">grinning</span> at me.&rdquo; The manager shifted uneasily. &ldquo;And I can smell something,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;&rsquo;S funny,&rdquo; said Nanny. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t smell a <span class="italic">thing</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">There was a change in the sound of the hooves outside, and the coach lurched as it slowed.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the manager awkwardly, &ldquo;I&hellip;er&hellip;I see we&rsquo;re stopping to change horses. It&rsquo;s a, a nice <a id="page99"></a>day. I think I may just, er, see if there&rsquo;s room on the seats outside.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">He left when the coach stopped. When it started again, a few minutes later, he hadn&rsquo;t come back.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Granny, as they lurched away again, &ldquo;it seems there&rsquo;s just you and me, Gytha. And Se&ntilde;or Basilica, who doesn&rsquo;t speak our language. Does he, Mr. Henry Slugg?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Henry Slugg took out a handkerchief and wiped his forehead. &ldquo;Ladies! Dear ladies! I beg you, for pity&rsquo;s sake&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Have you done anything bad, Mr. Slugg?&rdquo; said Nanny. &ldquo;Took advantage of women who dint want to be took advantage of? Stole? (Apart from lead on roofs and other stuff people wouldn&rsquo;t miss.) Done any murders of anyone who dint deserve it?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;He tellin&rsquo; the truth, Esme?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Henry writhed under Granny Weatherwax&rsquo;s stare.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Oh, well, that&rsquo;s all right, then,&rdquo; said Nanny. &ldquo;I <span class="italic">understand</span>. I don&rsquo;t have to pay taxes myself, but I know all about people not wantin&rsquo; to.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not that, I assure you,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;I have people to pay my taxes for me&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good trick,&rdquo; said Nanny.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Mr. Slugg&rsquo;s got a different trick,&rdquo; said Granny. &ldquo;I reckon I know the trick. It&rsquo;s like sugar and water.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Henry waved his hands uncertainly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that if they knew&hellip;&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s better if it comes from a long way away. That&rsquo;s the secret,&rdquo; said Granny.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip;yes, that&rsquo;s part of it,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;I mean, no one wants to listen to a Slugg.&rdquo;</p>
<a id="page100"></a>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;re you from, Henry?&rdquo; said Nanny.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;<span class="italic">Really</span> from,&rdquo; said Granny.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I grew up in Rookery Yard in the Shades. They&rsquo;re in Ankh-Morpork,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;It was a terrible rough place. There were only three ways out. You could sing your way out or you could fight your way out.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;What was the third way?&rdquo; said Nanny.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Oh, you could go down that little alleyway into Shamlegger Street and then cut down into Treacle Mine Road,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;But no one ever amounted to anything who went <span class="italic">that</span> way.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">He sighed. &ldquo;I made a few coppers singing in taverns and such like,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but when I tried for anything better they said &lsquo;What is your name?&rsquo; and I said &lsquo;Henry Slugg&rsquo; and they&rsquo;d laugh. I thought of changing my name, but everyone in Ankh-Morpork knew who I was. And no one wanted to listen to anyone called plain Henry Slugg.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Nanny nodded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like with conjurers,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re never called Fred Wossname. It&rsquo;s always something like The Great Astoundo, Fresh From the Court of the King of Klatch, and Gladys.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;And everyone takes notice,&rdquo; said Granny, &ldquo;and are always careful not to ask themselves: if he&rsquo;s come from the King of Klatch, why&rsquo;s he doing card tricks here in Slice, population seven.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;The trick is to make sure that everywhere you go, you are from somewhere else,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;And then I <span class="italic">was</span> famous, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;You&rsquo;d got stuck as Enrico,&rdquo; said Granny.</p>

<p class="para">He nodded. &ldquo;I was only going to do it to make some money. I was going to come back and marry my little Angeline&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<a id="page101"></a>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Who was she?&rdquo; said Granny.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Sharing the same gutter in the back streets of Ankh-Morpork, kind of thing?&rdquo; said Nanny, in an understanding voice.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Gutter? In those days you had to put your name down and wait five years for a gutter,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;We thought people in gutters were <span class="italic">nobs</span>. We shared a drain. With two other families. And a man who juggled eels.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">He sighed. &ldquo;But I moved on, and then there was always somewhere else to go, and they liked me in Brindisi&hellip;and&hellip;and&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">He blew his nose on the handkerchief, carefully folded it up, and produced another one from his pocket.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind the pasta and the squid,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, not much&hellip;But you can&rsquo;t get a decent pint for love nor money and they put olive oil on everything and tomatoes give me a rash and there isn&rsquo;t what I&rsquo;d call a good hard cheese in the whole country.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">He dabbed at his face with the handkerchief.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;And people are so kind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d get a few beefsteaks when I traveled but, <span class="italic">wherever</span> I go, they do pasta especially for me. In tomato sauce! Sometimes they fry it! And what they do to the squid&hellip;&rdquo; He shuddered. &ldquo;Then they all grin and watch me eat it. They think I enjoy it! What I&rsquo;d give for a plate of nice roast mutton with clootie dumplings&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you say?&rdquo; said Nanny.</p>

<p class="para">He shrugged. &ldquo;Enrico Basilica eats pasta,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much I can do about it now.&rdquo;</p>
<a id="page102"></a>

<p class="para">He sat back. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re interested in music, Mrs. Ogg?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Nanny nodded proudly. &ldquo;I can get a tune out of just about anything if you give me five minutes to study it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And our Jason can play the violin and our Kev can blow the trombone and all my kids can sing and our Shawn can fart any melody you care to name.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;A very talented family, indeed,&rdquo; said Enrico. He fumbled in a waistcoat pocket and took out two oblongs of cardboard. &ldquo;So please, ladies, accept these as a small token of gratitude from someone who eats other people&rsquo;s pies. Our little secret, eh?&rdquo; He winked desperately at Nanny. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re open tickets for the opera.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s amazin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Nanny, &ldquo;because we&rsquo;re going to&mdash;<span class="italic">Ow!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Why, thank you very much,&rdquo; said Granny Weatherwax, taking the tickets. &ldquo;How very gracious of you. We shall be sure to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;And if you&rsquo;ll excuse me,&rdquo; said Enrico, &ldquo;I must catch up on my sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I shouldn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s had time to get far away,&rdquo; said Nanny.</p>

<p class="para">The singer leaned back, pulled the handkerchief over his face and, after a few minutes, began to snore the happy snore of someone who had done his duty and now with any luck wouldn&rsquo;t have to meet these rather disconcerting old women ever again.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s well away,&rdquo; said Nanny, after a while. She glanced at the tickets in Granny&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;You want to visit the opera?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p class="para">Granny stared into space.</p>
<a id="page103"></a>

<p class="para">&ldquo;I <span class="italic">said</span>, do you want to visit the opera?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">Granny looked at the tickets. &ldquo;What I want don&rsquo;t signify, I suspect,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p class="para">Nanny Ogg nodded.</p>

<p class="para">Granny Weatherwax was firmly against fiction. Life was hard enough without lies floating around and changing the way people thought. And because the theater was fiction made flesh, she hated the theater most of all. But that was it&mdash;<span class="italic">hate</span> was exactly the right word. Hate is a force of attraction. Hate is just love with its back turned.</p>

<p class="para">She didn&rsquo;t <span class="italic">loathe</span> the theater, because, had she done so, she would have avoided it completely. Granny now took every opportunity to visit the traveling theater that came to Lancre, and sat bolt upright in the front row of every performance, staring fiercely. Even honest Punch and Judy men found her sitting among the children, snapping things like &ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t so!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Is that any way to behave?&rdquo; As a result, Lancre was becoming known throughout the Sto Plains as a really tough gig.</p>

<p class="para">But what she <span class="italic">wanted</span> wasn&rsquo;t important. Like it or not, witches are drawn to the edge of things, where two states collide. They feel the pull of doors, circumferences, boundaries, gates, mirrors, masks&hellip;</p>

<p class="para">Mrs. Plinge was shocked.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Mr. Pounder!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="para">The Opera House&rsquo;s professional rat catcher stopped, and lowered his struggling sack. Mr. Pounder wore an old opera hat to show that he was a cut above your normal rodent operative, and its brim was thick with wax and the old candle ends he used to light his way through the darker cellars.</p>

<p class="para">He&rsquo;d worked among the rats so long that there was something ratlike about him now. His face seemed to be merely a rearward extension of his nose. His mustache was bristly. His front teeth were prominent. People found themselves looking for his tail.</p>

<p class="para">Somewhere in the distance, there was a soft thump as a bundle of sandbags landed gently on the boards.</p>

<p class="para">The stage was big and bare and empty, except for a sack which was scuttling determinedly for freedom.</p>

<p class="para">She looked up.</p>

<p class="para">&ldquo;Mr. Pounder?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent">Mr. Pounder was used to darkness. It held no fears for him. And he&rsquo;d always prided himself on his night vision.

<p class="para">His candled hat&hellip;he&rsquo;d thought he&rsquo;d lost it but, it was strange, here it was, still on his head. Yes, indeed. He rubbed his throat thoughtfully. There was something important he couldn&rsquo;t quite remember&hellip;</p>

<p class="para">S<span class="smallCaps">QUEAK</span>?</p>

<p class="para">Standing in the air, at eye-level, was a robed figure about six inches high. A bony nose, with bent gray whiskers, protruded from the hood. Tiny skeletal fingers gripped a very small scythe.</p>

<p class="para">Mr. Pounder nodded thoughtfully to himself. You didn&rsquo;t rise to membership of the Inner Circle of the Guild of Rat Catchers without hearing a few whispered rumors. Rats had their own Death, they said, as well as their own kings, parliaments and nations. No human had ever seen it, though.</p>

<p class="para">Up until now.</p>

<p class="para">He felt honored. He&rsquo;d won the Golden Mallet for most rats caught every year for the past five years, but he respected them, as a soldier might respect a cunning and valiant enemy.</p>

<p class="para">The soul of Mr. Pounder looked at his hands.
