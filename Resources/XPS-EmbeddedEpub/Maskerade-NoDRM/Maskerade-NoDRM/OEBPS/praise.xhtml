<h2 class="reviewPageHead"><span class="xrefInternal"><a href="contents.xhtml#rev_01"><span class="bold">Praise</span></a></span> <span class="bold">for TERRY PRATCHETT&rsquo;s<br /> DISCWORLD</span></h2>

<p class="reviewPageText">&ldquo;Smart and funny.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Denver Post</span></p>

<p class="reviewPageText">&ldquo;Discworld is more complicated and satisfactory than Oz&hellip;. It has the energy of <span class="italic">The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy</span> and the inventiveness of <span class="italic">Alice in Wonderland</span>. It also has an intelligent wit and a truly original grim and comic grasp of the nature of things.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="reviewPageSource">A.S. Byatt</p>

<p class="reviewPageText">&ldquo;Humorously entertaining (and subtly thought-provoking) fantasy&hellip;Pratchett&rsquo;s Discworld books are filled with humor and with magic, but they&rsquo;re rooted in, of all things, real life and cold, hard reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Contra Costa Times</span></p>

<p class="reviewPageText">&ldquo;Pratchett has created an alternate universe full of trolls, dwarfs, wizards, and other fantasy elements, and he uses that universe to reflect on our own culture with entertaining and gloriously funny results. It&rsquo;s an accomplishment nothing short of magical.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Chicago Tribune</span></p>

<p class="reviewPageText">&ldquo;Discworld takes the classic fantasy universe through its logical, and comic, evolution.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Cleveland Plain Dealer</span></p>

<p class="reviewPageText">&ldquo;In [Pratchett&rsquo;s] range of invented characters, his adroit storytelling, and his clear-eyed acceptance of humankind&rsquo;s foibles, he reminds me of no one in English literature as much as Geoffrey Chaucer. No kidding.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Washington Post Book World</span></p>

<p class="reviewPageText">&ldquo;What makes Terry Pratchett&rsquo;s fantasies so entertaining is that their humor depends on the characters first, on the plot second, rather than the other way around. The story isn&rsquo;t there simply to lead from one slapstick pratfall to another pun. Its humor is genuine and unforced.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Ottawa Citizen</span></p>

<p class="reviewPageText">&ldquo;Terry Pratchett seems constitutionally unable to write a page without at least a twitch of the grin muscles&hellip;.[But] the notions Pratchett plays with are nae so narrow or nae so silly as your ordinary British farce. Seriously.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">San Diego Union-Tribune</span></p>

<p class="reviewPageText">&ldquo;Pratchett, for those not yet lucky enough to have discovered him, is one of England&rsquo;s most highly regarded satirists. Nothing&mdash;not religion, not politics, not anything&mdash;is safe from him.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">South Bend Tribune</span></p>

<p class="reviewPageText">&ldquo;Think J.R.R. Tolkien with a sharper, more satiric edge.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Houston Chronicle</span></p>

<p class="reviewPageText">&ldquo;The Discworld novels are a phenomenon.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel</span></p>

<p class="reviewPageText">&ldquo;Consistently, inventively mad&hellip;wild and wonderful.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Isaac Asimov&rsquo;s Science Fiction Magazine</span></p>

<p class="reviewPageText">&ldquo;He is head and shoulders above the best of the rest. He is screamingly funny. He is wise. He has style.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> (London)</p>

<p class="reviewPageText">&ldquo;Pratchett has now moved beyond the limits of humorous fantasy and should be recognized as one of the more significant contemporary English language satirists.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Publishers Weekly</span></p>

<p class="reviewPageText">&ldquo;Pratchett&rsquo;s humor is international, satirical, devious, knowing, irreverent, unsparing, and, above all, funny.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Kirkus Reviews</span></p>

<p class="reviewPageText">&ldquo;Pratchett demonstrates just how great the distance is between one-or two-joke writers and the comic masters whose work will be read into the next century.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Locus</span></p>

<p class="reviewPageText">&ldquo;If Terry Pratchett is not yet an institution, he should be.&rdquo;</p>
