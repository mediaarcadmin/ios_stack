    Keep track of: 
        Fully laid out child nodes.
        X/Y of start of current block content
        Current margin border and padding.
        Stack of left floats with end y position and width.
        Stack of right floats with end y position and width.
        "Current" line and line's max height so far.
        Node/Word/Break position of start of lines in current block.
 
    While we have subnodes
 
        If subnode is block
            Add previous block to laid out children list.
            Start new line (take into account "clear").
            Performing margin collapsing.

                    Parallel array maps to node id.
                    Second parallel array maps to hyphenation points.
            Create horizontally-sized valid-break structure.
                Remember to take into account indentation and any contents
                already on the line.
            Justify resulting paragraph.
            Store word + hyphenation point -> line end map.
                Work out line heights.
