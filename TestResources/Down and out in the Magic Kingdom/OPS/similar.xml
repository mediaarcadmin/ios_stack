Brother</a>, <em>Cory Doctorow</em></p>
<p>Marcus, a.k.a “w1n5t0n,” is only seventeen years old, but he
figures he already knows how the system works–and how to work the
system. Smart, fast, and wise to the ways of the networked world,
he has no trouble outwitting his high school’s intrusive but clumsy
surveillance systems.</p>
<p>But his whole world changes when he and his friends find
themselves caught in the aftermath of a major terrorist attack on
San Francisco. In the wrong place at the wrong time, Marcus and his
crew are apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security and
whisked away to a secret prison where they’re mercilessly
interrogated for days.</p>
<p>When the DHS finally releases them, Marcus discovers that his
city has become a police state where every citizen is treated like
a potential terrorist. He knows that no one will believe his story,
which leaves him only one option: to take down the DHS himself.</p>

to Town, Someone Leaves Town</a>, <em>Cory Doctorow</em></p>
<p>Alan is a middle-aged entrepeneur in contemporary Toronto, who
has devoted himself to fixing up a house in a bohemian
neighborhood. This naturally brings him in contact with the house
full of students and layabouts next door, including a young woman
who, in a moment of stress, reveals to him that she has
wings--wings, moreover, which grow back after each attempt to cut
them off.</p>
<p>Alan understands. He himself has a secret or two. His father is
a mountain; his mother is a washing machine; and among his brothers
are a set of Russian nesting dolls.</p>
<p>Now two of the three nesting dolls, Edward and Frederick, are on
his doorstep--well on their way to starvation, because their
innermost member, George, has vanished. It appears that yet another
brother, Davey, who Alan and his other siblings killed years ago,
may have returned...bent on revenge.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances it seems only reasonable for Alan to
involve himself with a visionary scheme to blanket Toronto with
free wireless Internet connectivity, a conspiracy spearheaded by a
brilliant technopunk who builds miracles of hardware from parts
scavenged from the city’s dumpsters. But Alan’s past won’t leave
him alone--and Davey is only one of the powers gunning for him and
all his friends.</p>

Standard Tribe</a>, <em>Cory Doctorow</em></p>
<p>A comedy of loyalty, betrayal, sex, madness, and
music-swapping<br />
Art is an up-and-coming interface designer, working on the
management of data flow along the Massachusetts Turnpike. He's
doing the best work of his career and can guarantee that the system
will be, without a question, the most counterintuitive,
user-hostile piece of software ever pushed forth onto the
world.</p>
<p>Why? Because Art is an industrial saboteur. He may live in
London and work for an EU telecommunications megacorp, but Art's
real home is the Eastern Standard Tribe.</p>
<p>Instant wireless communication puts everyone in touch with
everyone else, twenty-four hours a day. But one thing hasn't
changed: the need for sleep. The world is slowly splintering into
Tribes held together by a common time zone, less than family and
more than nations. Art is working to humiliate the Greenwich Mean
Tribe to the benefit of his own people. But in a world without
boundaries, nothing can be taken for granted-not happiness, not
money, and most certainly not love.</p>
<p>Which might explain why Art finds himself stranded on the roof
of an insane asylum outside Boston, debating whether to push a
pencil into his brain....</p>

War</a>, <em>Sun Tzu</em></p>
<p>The Art of War is a Chinese military treatise that was written
during the 6th century BC by Sun Tzu. Composed of 13 chapters, each
of which is devoted to one aspect of warfare, it has long been
praised as the definitive work on military strategies and tactics
of its time.<br />
The Art of War is one of the oldest books on military strategy in
the world. It is the first and one of the most successful works on
strategy and has had a huge influence on Eastern and Western
military thinking, business tactics, and beyond. Sun Tzu was the
first to recognize the importance of positioning in strategy and
that position is affected both by objective conditions in the
physical environment and the subjective opinions of competitive
actors in that environment. He taught that strategy was not
planning in the sense of working through a to-do list, but rather
that it requires quick and appropriate responses to changing
conditions. Planning works in a controlled environment, but in a
competitive environment,</p>
