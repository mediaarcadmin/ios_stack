<p class="noindentfirst">At 8.55 the following morning, Lenny carefully placed his school bag on to the desk, and gestured for James and Alexander to come over. After checking that no one else was watching, Lenny lifted a football shirt out of the bag and unwrapped it to reveal a small, home-made cage. James and Alexander crouched to peer at what was inside.</p>
<p class="indent">They found themselves faced with the most disgusting animal they had ever seen. The rat was covered with weeping sores, scars and</p>
<p class="image" id="image21"><a id="page69"></a><img src="images/image-22.jpg" alt="image 22"/></p>
<p class="noindent">infected boils. James had to look away, but Alexander simply stared.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;I thought you said he was just missing a bit of fur,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;He is,&rsquo; replied Lenny. &lsquo;The rest is just makeup. Stacey came round to visit Leandra that night, and I talked them into coming upstairs to help me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">James glared up at Lenny. &lsquo;Stacey Carmichael was in your bedroom?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page70"></a>Lenny nodded. &lsquo;For a couple of hours, yeah. That&rsquo;s her make-up all over Whiskers.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">Alexander laughed. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell him that, you&rsquo;ll have him snogging the rat if he thinks he can get a taste of Stacey&rsquo;s lipstick!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">James kicked Alexander&rsquo;s shin. &lsquo;Shut up!&rsquo; he hissed, blushing deeply.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;If I can drag you back to reality,&rsquo; muttered Alexander as he rubbed his leg and frowned at his friend. &lsquo;We need a plan to get Whiskers here down into the sewers.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">James shrugged. &lsquo;I just figured we were going to flush him down the toilet in cubicle four.&rsquo; He picked up the cage and stared at the rat inside. &lsquo;How long can he hold his breath for?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">Lenny snatched the cage from James and cradled it protectively. &lsquo;We are <i>not</i> flushing him down the toilet!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s bad enough that he has to suffer the indignity of being plastered in make-up.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page71"></a>&lsquo;Yeah, I bet he really hated lying in Stacey&rsquo;s lap while she pampered him for a couple of hours,&rsquo; agreed Alexander.</p>
<p class="indent">As the bell rang for assembly, Lenny wrapped the cage up in his shirt again, and slipped it back inside his bag. It was going to be a long morning.</p>
<p class="noindentfirst">&lsquo;The first letters from General Ned Ludd and the Army of Redressers were received by employers in Nottingham during the early months of eighteen-eleven,&rsquo; droned Mr Hall, forty minutes into an already dragging second period of double history. As far as James and Lenny were concerned, he might as well have been talking about defusing thermo-nuclear devices. Assembly had been bad enough, but this was torture.</p>
<p class="indent">Even Alexander was fidgeting. His textbook remained closed for the first time in living <a id="page72"></a>memory. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get back into Wharpley&rsquo;s workroom,&rsquo; he whispered to James. &lsquo;I think I remember seeing a manhole cover in the floor which should lead to the sewers.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;You <i>think</i> you saw a manhole cover?&rsquo; replied James. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not sure?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;If you recall,&rsquo; said Alexander, &lsquo;I was only in there for a second after Frankenstein back there had caused chaos with his size tens. I didn&rsquo;t have time to have a proper look around.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;OK,&rsquo; whispered James. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll go down there at lunchtime and release the plague back into the pit.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;Do you think the ghosts will fall for it?&rsquo; asked Alexander.</p>
<p class="indent">James shrugged. &lsquo;Who knows what they&rsquo;ll do. But it&rsquo;s got to be worth a try. After all, what ghost in its right mind would want to be faced with the very disease that sent it to their grave?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page73"></a>&lsquo;Is this a private conversation, or can anyone join in?&rsquo; boomed a voice.</p>
<p class="indent">Alexander looked up to see that Mr Hall, along with most of the class, was staring at their desk. &lsquo;I was, er, just explaining something about the Black Death of medieval times to James, sir,&rsquo; he said, pleasantly.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr Hall nodded to his star pupil. &lsquo;As commendable as your interest in history is, Alexander, you are around four hundred years off the mark for today&rsquo;s lesson. We are discussing the machinery of the industrial revolution&mdash;something you would know if you had bothered to open your textbook!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">Someone sniggered as Alexander flicked through the book, trying to find the correct page. &lsquo;Yes, sir. Sorry, sir,&rsquo; he mumbled as Mr Hall turned back to face the board.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;Now, the spinning jenny used a series of eight spindles as opposed to&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page74"></a>&lsquo;SQUEAK!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">Mr Hall turned round and glared at the sea of surprised faces that greeted him. &lsquo;What was that?&rsquo; he demanded. No one seemed to know, as they were looking all around the room to find the source of the sound themselves.</p>
<p class="indent">James groaned. He knew exactly what it was, and a quick glance back at Lenny showed that his friend did, too. Lenny&rsquo;s eyes were shut tight, his school bag clamped tightly between his feet. James held his breath until Mr Hall turned his attention back to the board.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;As I was saying, the spinning jenny used eight spindles instead of one, and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;SQUEAK!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">Mr Hall spun round, his face red with rage. &lsquo;I distinctly heard a noise!&rsquo; he shouted. &lsquo;And I demand to know what it is!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">Slowly, Lenny raised his hand.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;What&rsquo;s he doing?&rsquo; hissed Alexander.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page75"></a>&lsquo;No, please don&rsquo;t tell him. <i>Please</i> don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; muttered James under his breath.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;Leonard?&rsquo; said the history teacher. &lsquo;Do you know what&rsquo;s making that noise?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">James had his face buried in his hands.</p>
<p class="indent">Lenny nodded. &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; he admitted. &lsquo;It was me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">James looked up, amazed.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;You?&rsquo; asked Mr Hall.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; repeated Lenny, his voice more confident now. &lsquo;I was making the sound of a spinning jenny.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;A spinning jenny?&rsquo; asked Mr Hall.</p>
<p class="indent">Lenny looked as though he might faint at any moment. &lsquo;I want to be a spinning <i>Lenny,</i>&lsquo; he muttered, clearing his throat. &lsquo;Er, squeak! Squeak! Squeak!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">The class burst into laughter, all except for James and Alexander who breathed heavy sighs of relief.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page76"></a>Mr Hall stared at Lenny for a moment in disbelief, unsure what to say. &lsquo;OK,&rsquo; he finally replied. &lsquo;Very good. But if you could keep the impressions to a minimum, we&rsquo;ll all get a lot more done.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">Shaking his head, Mr Hall turned back to the board and continued to write. &lsquo;Now, the spinning jenny&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">James turned in his chair in time to spot Lenny ripping apart a sandwich and pushing the pieces down into his bag, presumably trying to keep Whiskers more interested in food than in making noises.</p>
<p class="indent">The bell rang and chairs scraped across the floor as everyone jumped to their feet, eager for the fresh air of the playground. As Mr Hall barked out homework instructions, Lenny hoisted his bag to his shoulder and joined his friends.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;A spinning Lenny?&rsquo; asked Alexander, dubiously.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page77"></a>&lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t think of anything else,&rsquo; admitted Lenny.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;Well, at least he didn&rsquo;t find Whiskers,&rsquo; said James. &lsquo;Come on. Let&rsquo;s get down to the cellar before anything else happens.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">He led the way from the classroom, past Mr Hall who patted Lenny on the shoulder. &lsquo;Is there anything you&rsquo;d like to talk about, Leonard?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p class="indent">Lenny shook his head. &lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I, er, just really like the technology of the early textile industry.&rsquo; And, with that, he dashed out of the classroom, leaving his history teacher with what would easily prove to be the best staffroom anecdote of the week.</p>
