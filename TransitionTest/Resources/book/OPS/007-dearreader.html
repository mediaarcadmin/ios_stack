<h1><a id="pagexi"></a><a href="008-toc.html">Dear Reader</a></h1>
<p class="noindentfirst">As you may have already guessed, B, Strange is not a real name.</p>
<p class="noindentfirst">The author of this series is an ex-teacher who is currently employed by a little-known body called the Organisation For Spook Termination (Excluding Demons), or O.F.S.T.(E.D.). &lsquo;B. Strange&rsquo; is the pen name chosen to protect his identity.</p>
<p class="noindentfirst">Together, we felt it was our duty to publish these books, in an attempt to save innocent lives. The stories are based on the author&rsquo;s experiences as an O.F.S.T.(E.D.) inspector in various schools over the past two decades.</p>
<p class="noindentfirst">Please read them carefully&mdash;you may regret it if you don&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p class="noindentfirst">Yours sincerely The Publisher.</p>
<p class="noindentfirst">PS&mdash;Should you wish to file a report on any suspicious supernatural occurrences at your school, visit <b>www.too-ghoul.com</b> and fill out the relevant form. We&rsquo;ll pass it on to O.F.S.T.(E.D.) for you.</p>
<p class="noindentfirst">PPS&mdash;All characters&rsquo; names have been changed to protect the identity of the individuals. Any similarity to actual persons, living or undead, is purely coincidental.</p>
