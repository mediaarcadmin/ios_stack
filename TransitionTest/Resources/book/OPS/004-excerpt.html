<p class="noindentfirst">The door to the girls&rsquo; toilets opened slowly, and James cautiously took a step inside.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; asked Alexander, forcing the door wide and pushing past him. &lsquo;Scared something might bite you?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;No,&rsquo; answered James, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;ve never been inside the girls&rsquo; toilets before.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">Suddenly, the loo inside the closed cubicle let out a loud burp, and Lenny backed away from the door. &lsquo;Leandra says that one&rsquo;s the haunted one,&rsquo; he muttered.</p>
<p class="indent">Alexander laughed. &lsquo;A haunted toilet is a scientific impossibility.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">But the words stuck in his throat as the toilet let out another enormous belch. James gasped as a withered, grey human hand launched itself up from the water, and landed on his face.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="pageii"></a><b>St Sebastian&rsquo;s School in Grimesford is the pits. No, really&mdash;it is.</b></p>
<p class="noindentfirst">Every year, the high school sinks a bit further into the boggy plague pit beneath it and, every year, the ghosts of the plague victims buried underneath it become a bit more cranky.</p>
<p class="indent">Egged on by their spooky ringleader, Edith Codd, they decide to get their own back&mdash;and they&rsquo;re willing to play dirty. <i>Really</i> dirty.</p>
<p class="indent">They kick up a stink by causing as much mischief as in inhumanly possible so as to get St Sebastian&rsquo;s closed down once and for all.</p>
<p class="indent">But what they haven&rsquo;t reckoned on is year-seven new boy, James Simpson and his friends Alexander and Lenny.</p>
<p class="indent">The question is, are the gang up to the challenge of laying St Sebastian&rsquo;s paranormal problem to rest, or will their school remain forever frightful?</p>
