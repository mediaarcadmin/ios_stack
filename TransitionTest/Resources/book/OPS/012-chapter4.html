<h1><a id="page32"></a><a href="008-toc.html#ch4">CHAPTER 4<br/>GHOUL&rsquo;S OUT</a></h1>
<p class="noindentfirst">&lsquo;Order! Order!&rsquo; yelled Edith Codd, banging a human skull repeatedly on to an upturned barrel. &lsquo;I insist upon order, or there will be no surface passes handed out this Halloween whatsoever!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">Reluctantly, over a thousand men, women and children stopped their nattering and turned their attentions towards Edith. She sighed heavily; this job would be the death of her. If she hadn&rsquo;t already been dead for over six hundred years, of course.</p>
<p class="image" id="image15"><a id="page33"></a><img src="images/image-16.jpg" alt="image 16"/></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page34"></a>&lsquo;Ambrose Harbottle, are you chewing?&rsquo; she quizzed, leaning over the top of her barrel. The middle-aged ghost glanced around casually before realising with horror that Edith was talking to him.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;Mmm-mm!&rsquo; he mumbled, shaking his head, then he pretended to cough and slipped the juicy leech out of his mouth as silently as he could. Beside him, a young ghoul sniggered noisily and nudged his fellow spirit in the ribs.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;She got you!&rsquo; he teased.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;William Scroggins! One hundred lines: I must not mock fellow members of the walking deceased!&rsquo; bellowed Edith.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;Aw!&rsquo; moaned William. &lsquo;I was going to play catch with the Headless Horseman after this, as well!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">Edith took a deep breath and gazed around the enormous underground cavern constructed painstakingly over the past six centuries by the <a id="page35"></a>ghosts and ghouls in front of her. What had once been a school sewer system was now an amphitheatre of incredible proportions. If only the assembled legions of the undead would appreciate it.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;First order of business,&rsquo; began Edith, as efficiently as she could given the circumstances. &lsquo;I think we would all like to thank Lady Grimes for her ectoplasm-renewal workshop last week. I know a lot of you attended, and the benefits are obvious, as many of you don&rsquo;t look a day over three hundred as a result.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">Lady Grimes stood to receive a smattering of bored applause.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;Next, I am saddened to announce that the bones of our dear departed selves have been tampered with again! May I remind you that we died from the Black Death, people, and that disturbing the unmarked graves into which we were tossed without ceremony will do little if <a id="page36"></a>anything to help the environment.&rsquo; Edith sighed again. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s bad enough that we have to deal with ghostal warming, without some prankster building goalposts from the spines of plague victims.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">A barely disguised laugh echoed from the back of the hall, and Edith glared in its direction. &lsquo;And don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t know what you did with my former ribs, Bertram Ruttle! It&rsquo;s not big and it&rsquo;s not clever&mdash;even if it is musical.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">A wave of chatter spread through the amphitheatre again, and Edith was forced to hammer the skull down once more. To the amusement of William, it shattered into a hundred pieces although Edith, ignoring her own orders about disturbing graves, simply dug her hand down into the soil and pulled up another to use. A tiny voice to the left was heard to cry out: &lsquo;Hey, that&rsquo;s me!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;Order! Order!&rsquo; Edith&rsquo;s wafer-thin patience was wearing down even further. The closest thing to <a id="page37"></a>silence she was likely to get eventually prevailed. &lsquo;And, our final item on the agenda&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">Suddenly, Edith was interrupted by the ringing of a muffled bell from above. Every ghost in the cavern raised its eyes towards the roof of the sewer as a thousand pairs of children&rsquo;s feet hit the floor at the same time and began to clatter about. The noise was tremendous, and bits of old pipe rained down upon the crowd, turning a number of phantoms into little more than puddles of spectral goo.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;&mdash;St Sebastian&rsquo;s School!&rsquo; growled Edith as she finished her sentence unheard. Thankfully, it was lunchtime, and the din subsided slightly as most of the children headed outside to the playground.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;As you know, Ambrose Harbottle has been working hard on what he likes to call &ldquo;Terror in Cubicle Four&rdquo;, otherwise know to the rest of us as &ldquo;Operation Stupid Purple Tentacle!&rdquo; &rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page38"></a>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s not fair!&rsquo; yelled Ambrose, angrily. &lsquo;It took all my energy to transform into that tentacle, <i>and</i> I managed to scare at least five pupils!&rsquo; He folded his arms, sulking. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a trio of children who won&rsquo;t be weeing into <i>that</i>particular toilet for the foreseeable future!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;As successful as you consider your plan to have been, Ambrose, the simple truth is that it hasn&rsquo;t worked,&rsquo; responded Edith. &lsquo;The school is still open. We&rsquo;ll have to scare more than three pupils in order to get it closed down.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">She gazed from blank face to blank face in the audience before her. &lsquo;Do you want this racket to continue after every single lesson? Shall we just sit here and wait until the foundations of the school collapse in on us? Are our remains not precious and sacred?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">As if to underscore the speech, Bertram Ruttle picked out a military march on the xylophone he&rsquo;d constructed from Edith&rsquo;s ribs.</p>
<p class="image" id="image16"><a id="page39"></a><img src="images/image-17.jpg" alt="image 17"/></p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;These children need a good fright, people! We must frighten them with the leeches, we must frighten them in the classrooms and in the lab. Give us the ghouls, and we will finish the job!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">Edith&rsquo;s eyes glowed red as her passion grew and, for the first time in history, all the plaguepit ghosts&mdash;with the exception of William and Ambrose&mdash;were being carried along with her. <a id="page40"></a>This was her moment. This was when she would begin the downfall of St Sebastian&rsquo;s School. &lsquo;Ask not what your tomb can do for you for, but what you can do for your tomb!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">The ghosts were already on their feet, applauding wildly as she struck a pose and cried out, &lsquo;Go forth and terrify!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">As a swell of pride and enthusiasm washed away centuries of indifference, Edith Codd pointed a bony finger at the spirit of the young farm boy who had been cut down by the Black Death at the tender age of eleven.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;William Scroggins,&rsquo; she screamed. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re going to the surface!&rsquo;</p>
