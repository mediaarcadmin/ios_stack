<p class="centerfirst"><b>The Black Death</b> was a terrible plague that<br/>is believed to have been spread by fleas on rats.<br/>It swept through Europe in the fourteenth century,<br/>arriving in England in 1348, where it killed<br/>over one third of the population.</p>
<p class="centerfirst">One of the Black Death&rsquo;s main symptoms was<br/><b>foul-smelling boils all over the body called<br/>&lsquo;buboes&rsquo;.</b> The plague was so infectious that its<br/>victims and their families were locked in their houses<br/>until they died. Many villages were abandoned as<br/>the disease wiped out their populations.</p>
<p class="centerfirst">So many people died that graveyards overflowed<br/>and bodies lay in the street, so special <b>&lsquo;plague pits&rsquo;</b><br/>were dug to bury the bodies. Almost every town<br/>and village in England has a plague pit<br/>somewhere underneath it, so watch out<br/>when you&rsquo;re digging in the garden&hellip;</p>
