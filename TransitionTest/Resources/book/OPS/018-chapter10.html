<p class="noindentfirst">&lsquo;I shall be calling your parents immediately!&rsquo; announced Mr Tick.</p>
<p class="indent">The headmaster had been extremely busy when Mr Wharpley had barged into his office moaning about &lsquo;three ruffians who had cruelly ruined his entire collection of tools&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="indent">He&rsquo;d just placed a red nine on the black ten, and was well on his way to an all-time solitaire speed record. Of course, as soon as the caretaker had appeared, Mr Tick had clicked a link that replaced the game on the computer screen with</p>
<p class="image" id="image25"><a id="page90"></a><img src="images/image-26.jpg" alt="image 26"/></p>
<p class="noindent">a very dull and official-looking spreadsheet. He couldn&rsquo;t have the staff thinking he was wasting his time.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;All right, Mr Wharpley, send them in,&rsquo; he had sighed, gazing longingly at his keyboard, fingers itching to get back to the game.</p>
<p class="indent">The three boys trudged unhappily into the room and stood, heads hung low, in front of Mr <a id="page91"></a>Tick&rsquo;s desk. The headmaster was dismayed to see his own son among the accused. This was going to take longer than he&rsquo;d hoped, and the computer clock was still ticking away. The solitaire speed record, and his proud boasts about the result on his favourite Internet forum, Solitaire Isn&rsquo;t Just For Saddos, would have to wait until another day.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;I caught them digging up the floor of my workroom with my best tools,&rsquo; exclaimed Mr Wharpley, determined to see the wrongdoers receive the maximum penalty the school rules would allow: expulsion.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;That will be all, Mr Wharpley,&rsquo; announced the headmaster. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take it from here.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;B-but, I want to make sure that&mdash;&rsquo; spluttered the caretaker.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;I said, I&rsquo;ll take it from here!&rsquo; instructed Mr Tick.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr Wharpley stomped out of the office, complaining under his breath about the <a id="page92"></a>treatment of manual workers in today&rsquo;s society. The door slammed behind him.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;We weren&rsquo;t digging up the floor, Dad,&rsquo; said Alexander once the caretaker had gone.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr Tick raised a finger in his son&rsquo;s direction. &lsquo;You know the rules, Alexander,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;From nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning to three-twenty in the afternoon I am <i>not</i> your father, I am your <i>headmaster.</i>&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">Alexander groaned. &lsquo;OK, we weren&rsquo;t digging up the floor, <i>sir!</i>&lsquo; he muttered.</p>
<p class="indent">A catchy jingle played from the computer speakers. The solitaire game was over; time had run out. Mr Tick sighed as he reached across to lower the volume. &lsquo;So, what were you doing down there?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">James and Lenny glanced at each other nervously, trying hard to think of an excuse for trespassing in the caretaker&rsquo;s room. But Alexander beat them to it.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page93"></a>&lsquo;One of the year-nine kids knocked Lenny&rsquo;s football out of his hands, and it bounced down the stairs into Mr Wharpley&rsquo;s room,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;We went to retrieve it and, of course, to make sure it hadn&rsquo;t caused any damage.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">Mr Tick sat back in his chair, considering the answer. &lsquo;Then why did Mr Wharpley claim that you were digging into the floor with his tools?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">James was convinced that they had now been found out, but Alexander continued with his lies, undeterred. &lsquo;Once we found the football, we turned to leave. And that&rsquo;s when we heard the sound.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;What sound?&rsquo; asked Mr Tick. James and Lenny stared at Alexander. Yes, what sound?</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;It sounded like crying,&rsquo; Alexander continued, &lsquo;and we thought that maybe an animal had somehow fallen into the drains below the room and become stuck. So, we were trying to lift the manhole cover in the floor to see if we <a id="page94"></a>could rescue it. That&rsquo;s when Mr Wharpley discovered us.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">James shook his head. Where did Alexander get this stuff and, more importantly, why did he think it would wash with his father?</p>
<p class="indent">Mr Tick swivelled in his plush office chair, looking from dirty face to dirty face in front of him. &lsquo;And where is this football now?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p class="indent">Alexander paled. &lsquo;E-excuse me?&rsquo; he stammered.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;You said you went down to Mr Wharpley&rsquo;s room to retrieve a football,&rsquo; said Mr Tick, calmly. &lsquo;Where is it now?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Say we couldn&rsquo;t find it,</i> thought James. <i>Say we couldn&rsquo;t find it.</i></p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s in Lenny&rsquo;s bag!&rsquo; announced Alexander. James wondered what the punishment would be for giving the headmaster&rsquo;s son a dead arm in front of him.</p>
<p class="indent">All eyes fell on Lenny&rsquo;s school bag that currently sat on a chair at the side of the desk.</p>
<p class="image" id="image26"><a id="page95"></a><img src="images/image-27.jpg" alt="image 27"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Mr Tick got to his feet and lifted the bag on to his desk. Slowly, he dragged the zip back and slid his hand inside the holdall.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;SQUEAK!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">The noise caused the headmaster to pull his hand back out of the bag in horror. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s in there?&rsquo; he demanded. This time, even Alexander didn&rsquo;t have an answer. &lsquo;I asked what is in there!&rsquo; roared the headmaster. The boys all stayed silent.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page96"></a>&lsquo;Empty the contents of the bag on to my desk!&rsquo; commanded Mr Tick, keeping his own hands clear of the bag. He&rsquo;d never beat the solitaire record if he found himself missing a couple of fingers.</p>
<p class="indent">James watched miserably as Lenny placed a pile of textbooks down in front of the headmaster. He&rsquo;d have to produce Whiskers next, and the boys would then go down in history as the first pupils ever to be expelled for bringing the Black Death into school.</p>
<p class="indent">Lenny dropped his pencil case on to the desk and then hesitated, reluctant to take the cage containing Whiskers out of his bag.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;I shall be calling your parents immediately,&rsquo; announced Mr Tick, &lsquo;if you do not empty that bag right <i>now</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">Sighing, Lenny reached inside for Whiskers.</p>
<p class="indent">At that moment, the door to the office slammed open. Everyone spun round, half <a id="page97"></a>expecting to see the enraged caretaker again, but instead they found themselves faced with the headmaster&rsquo;s secretary, Miss Keys.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;He&rsquo;s missing!&rsquo; she blurted out, breathlessly. &lsquo;He hasn&rsquo;t been seen since this morning!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">Mr Tick darted round his desk and led his secretary to a chair, helping her to sit. &lsquo;Calm down, woman,&rsquo; he ordered. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re hysterical.&rsquo; Miss Keys grabbed the remainder of the headmaster&rsquo;s cup of tea that had gone cold while he&rsquo;d been concentrating on where to place that red queen, and gulped it down in one.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;Now, who&rsquo;s missing?&rsquo; demanded Mr Tick, taking the &lsquo;Solitaire Champ&rsquo; mug from her trembling hands before anything untoward happened to it.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;Gordon Carver!&rsquo; announced Miss Keys. James, Lenny and Alexander exchanged glances at the news. &lsquo;He didn&rsquo;t turn up for PE, and no one&rsquo;s seen him since registration!&rsquo; added the secretary.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page98"></a>Mr Tick remained composed. &lsquo;The Carver boy has been known to skip lessons before, Miss Keys. Have you checked with the boy&rsquo;s parents?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">Miss Keys nodded furiously. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s not at home, either. And no one saw him leaving the school grounds!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">Mr Tick turned to the boys who remained motionless before his desk. &lsquo;Out!&rsquo; he commanded.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;But, Dad&mdash;,&rsquo; began Alexander, stopping only when James nudged him painfully in the ribs.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;I said, get out!&rsquo; shouted the headmaster. &lsquo;You too, Miss Keys!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">The boys grabbed the contents of Lenny&rsquo;s bag and followed the secretary out of the office.</p>
<p class="indent">As the door closed behind them, Mr Tick dropped unhappily back into his chair. A missing pupil; that&rsquo;s all he needed. Personally, he didn&rsquo;t much care for Gordon Carver, or indeed for any of the other pupils at the school. But a missing pupil could mean he&rsquo;d lose his job.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page99"></a>There was no way he would be able to afford his annual trip to the Norwich Solitaire Convention if that happened.</p>
