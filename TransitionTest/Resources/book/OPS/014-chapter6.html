<h1><a id="page51"></a><a href="008-toc.html#ch6">CHAPTER 6<br/>THE BLUEPRINT</a></h1>
<p class="noindentfirst">All the way through double maths, Alexander was itching to reach inside his rucksack, pull out the tube of paper and examine it. Still, as distractions went, complex algebra was up there with the best, and so he tackled the work with enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="indent">James, on the other hand, didn&rsquo;t find much comfort in equations. All he could think about was that Lenny had possibly stumbled upon the greatest clue to the cubicle four mystery so far. What could be written on the rolled-up paper? <a id="page52"></a>Would it help them to understand what was going on in the girls&rsquo; toilets? Or would it just complicate the situation more?</p>
<p class="indent">Glancing over his shoulder, James spotted Lenny staring out of the window, a troubled expression on his face. In a little over six minutes the bell would ring for break, and they would be able to find out what information the paper contained. Unless Alexander raised his hand and started asking questions, of course. James tried to grab his wrist and pull his arm back down, but Alexander simply raised his other hand. What was he doing now?</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;Please, Mr Parker, what would you say were the most effective methods for dealing with algebraic manipulation?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">The maths teacher&rsquo;s face lit up. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you asked that, Alexander, although the answer might take some time to explain&hellip;&rsquo; The entire class groaned with frustration.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page53"></a>James and Lenny exchanged glances. The secrets of their find might have to wait longer than six minutes.</p>
<p class="noindentfirst">Had James and Lenny not been pacing impatiently behind the bike sheds, they might have noticed someone spying on them. He was a slight boy, thin almost to the point of being skeletal, and the shock of dirty blonde hair on top of his head gave him the look of a walking floor mop.</p>
<p class="indent">William Scroggins concentrated hard to stay in a form that appeared to be as solid as possible. His fact-finding mission would be over very soon indeed if one of the school pupils or staff discovered they could see right through him.</p>
<p class="indent">As Alexander arrived, weighed down with extra maths books, William tiptoed closer to eavesdrop on the conversation.</p>
<p class="noindentfirst"><a id="page54"></a>&lsquo;Well, if it isn&rsquo;t Captain Pythagoras!&rsquo; exclaimed Lenny as Alexander appeared.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; came the reply.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;<i>Ten minutes!</i>&lsquo; said Lenny. &lsquo;You kept us in maths for an extra <i>ten whole minutes</i> while Parker answered your question. Let me tell you, Stick, your popularity isn&rsquo;t exactly at its peak right now!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;Some things are important!&rsquo; countered Alexander. &lsquo;I was eager to discover whether the mechanics of probability had altered over the centuries.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;Oddball,&rsquo; muttered Lenny as he pulled a chocolate bar from his coat pocket and took a bite. James stepped between them.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;As fascinating as this conversation is,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;we&rsquo;ve only got five minutes of break left. Where&rsquo;s the roll of paper?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page55"></a>Alexander carefully piled his new textbooks on the ground and pulled the tube of paper from his rucksack. Taking a deep breath, he untied the knot in the black ribbon and unfurled the paper in his hands. James and Lenny craned to look.</p>
<p class="indent">The paper contained a detailed plan, with a neatly written heading above. &lsquo;Saint Sebastian&rsquo;s School, Grimesford,&rsquo; read James aloud. &lsquo;Built on the site of the medieval plague pit.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;P-plague pit?&rsquo; stammered Lenny, gazing at the remains of his chocolate bar with disgust before tossing it aside. &lsquo;You mean, there are dead bodies underneath us, <i>right now?</i>&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;Well, statistically speaking there are bodies beneath you for much of your day,&rsquo; droned Alexander. &lsquo;The bodies of previous generations weren&rsquo;t always buried in official graveyards.&rsquo; Lenny rolled his eyes and sighed at the first sign of yet another history lesson. &lsquo;But, yes, if the school <i>is</i> built over a medieval plague pit, there <a id="page56"></a>will be plenty of dead bodies underneath us right now.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">James studied the plan. &lsquo;What <i>is</i> this?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a blueprint for the school,&rsquo; answered Alexander. &lsquo;The original, Victorian building by the look of it.&rsquo; He gestured to the largest room on the diagram. &lsquo;That will be what&rsquo;s the assembly hall these days.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">James shook his head in amazement as Alexander continued to point out individual rooms on the blueprint. Lenny, however, simply stared down at the ground, thinking hard.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the cause of that weird stuff in the toilets,&rsquo; he announced. James and Alexander looked up. &lsquo;The tentacle and the hand,&rsquo; continued Lenny. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the ghosts of the people buried beneath the school. They&rsquo;re trying to scare us off.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;A ridiculous notion,&rsquo; snorted Alexander. &lsquo;As I said earlier, the existence of spectral apparitions has yet to be conclusively proven.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page57"></a>James looked at his friend. &lsquo;Do you have a better explanation for what&rsquo;s happening?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">Alexander thought for a second before replying, &lsquo;No. I don&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;So, what do we do?&rsquo; asked Lenny.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;Contact <i>New Scientist,</i> or one of the other respected scientific journals!&rsquo; exclaimed Alexander. &lsquo;If we&rsquo;ve witnessed what I think we&rsquo;ve witnessed, we could have convincing proof of a conscious afterlife! It&rsquo;s our duty!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;All in good time, professor,&rsquo; said James. &lsquo;But I was thinking more of what we can do to stop these things from terrorising the school.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">Alexander&rsquo;s face twisted into a mischievous grin&mdash;a sure sign that what was to come would be incredibly cheesy. &lsquo;I think we can all agree that it&rsquo;s a very <i>grave</i> situation!&rsquo; he announced.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;Your jokes are terrifyingly bad!&rsquo; said James.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s it! We could scare the ghosts off,&rsquo; suggested Lenny.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page58"></a>&lsquo;With his comedy?&rsquo; asked James.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;No!&rsquo; replied Lenny. &lsquo;Something else.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;Attempt to scare those who frighten us?&rsquo; mused Alexander. &lsquo;Turn the tables, as it were. A daring plan, to say the least. But how?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Lenny, concentrating hard on the plan that was forming in his mind. &lsquo;If they died from the plague, they&rsquo;ll be scared of it. If we could make them think it&rsquo;s back&mdash;they might disappear and leave us alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">Alexander stared, open-mouthed. &lsquo;You want to recreate the Black Death in an effort to petrify its original victims?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">Lenny nodded. &lsquo;I rescued a rat I found trapped down a drain last week,&rsquo; he explained. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a scabby old thing: bits of fur missing, an eye infection and a big chunk out of its tail. With a bit of make-up, I reckon it could pass as a plague carrier. We just send it down into the sewers to stir things up a bit.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page59"></a>&lsquo;Are you still picking up stray animals and keeping them in your bedroom?&rsquo; asked James.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;I keep the rat hidden in a box under my bed,&rsquo; explained Lenny, &lsquo;along with a hedgehog that was attacked by a neighbour&rsquo;s dog, and a mole I found unconscious in the garden.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;Your mum will go mental if she finds out,&rsquo; said James.</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;I say that&rsquo;s a risk worth taking,&rsquo; said Alexander. &lsquo;The plan has merit.&rsquo; He turned to Lenny. &lsquo;So, what do you call this repulsive beast?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="indent">Lenny grinned. &lsquo;Whiskers!&rsquo;</p>
