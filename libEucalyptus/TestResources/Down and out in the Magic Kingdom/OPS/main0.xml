<p>I could never have written this book without the personal
support of my friends and family, especially Roz Doctorow, Gord
Doctorow and Neil Doctorow, Amanda Foubister, Steve Samenski, Pat
York, Grad Conn, John Henson, John Rose, the writers at the Cecil
Street Irregulars and Mark Frauenfelder.</p>
<p>I owe a great debt to the writers and editors who mentored and
encouraged me: James Patrick Kelly, Judith Merril, Damon Knight,
Martha Soukup, Scott Edelman, Gardner Dozois, Renee Wilmeth, Teresa
Nielsen Hayden, Claire Eddy, Bob Parks and Robert Killheffer.</p>
<p>I am also indebted to my editor Patrick Nielsen Hayden and my
agent Donald Maass, who believed in this book and helped me bring
it to fruition.</p>
<p>Finally, I must thank the readers, the geeks and the Imagineers
who inspired this book.</p>
