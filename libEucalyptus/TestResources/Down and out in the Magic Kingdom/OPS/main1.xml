<h3 class="section_title">A note about this book, February 12,
2004:</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>As you will see, when you read the text beneath this section, I
released this book a little over a year ago under the terms of a
Creative Commons license that allowed my readers to freely
redistribute the text without needing any further permission from
me. In this fashion, I enlisted my readers in the service of a
grand experiment, to see how my book could find its way into
cultural relevance and commercial success. The experiment worked
out very satisfactorily.</p>
<p>When I originally licensed the book under the terms set out in
the next section, I did so in the most conservative fashion
possible, using CC's most restrictive license. I wanted to dip my
toe in before taking a plunge. I wanted to see if the sky would
fall: you see writers are routinely schooled by their peers that
maximal copyright is the only thing that stands between us and
penury, and so ingrained was this lesson in me that even though I
had the intellectual intuition that a "some rights reserved" regime
would serve me well, I still couldn't shake the atavistic fear that
I was about to do something very foolish indeed.</p>
<p>It wasn't foolish. I've since released a short story collection
(A Place So Foreign and Eight More and a second novel (Eastern
Standard Tribe) in this fashion, and my career is turning over like
a goddamned locomotive engine. I am thrilled beyond words (an
extraordinary circumstance for a writer!) at the way that this has
all worked out.</p>
<p>And so now I'm going to take a little bit of a plunge. Today, in
coincidence with my talk at the O'Reilly Emerging Technology
Conference (Ebooks: Neither E, Nor Books).</p>
<p>I am re-licensing this book under a far less restrictive
Creative Commons license, the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike
license. This is a license that allows you, the reader, to
noncommercially "remix" this book â€” you have my blessing to make
your own translations, radio and film adaptations, sequels, fan
fiction, missing chapters, machine remixes, you name it. A number
of you assumed that you had my blessing to do this in the first
place, and I can't say that I've been at all put out by the
delightful and creative derivative works created from this book,
but now you have my explicit blessing, and I hope you'll use
it.</p>
<p>Here's the license in summary:</p>
<p>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/1.0/</p>
<p>You are free:</p>
<p>* to copy, distribute, display, and perform the work</p>

<p>THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.</p>
<p>BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT
AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR
GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR
ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.</p>
<p>1. Definitions</p>
<p>1. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,
constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
defined below) for the purposes of this License.</p>
<p>2. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon
the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation,
musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion
picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
purpose of this License.</p>
<p>3. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the
Work under the terms of this License.</p>
<p>4. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created
the Work.</p>
<p>5. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered
under the terms of this License.</p>
<p>6. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under
this License who has not previously violated the terms of this
License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License
despite a previous violation.</p>
<p>2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to
reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use first
sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright
owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.</p>
<p>3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
below:</p>
<p>1. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or
more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in
the Collective Works;</p>
<p>2. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;</p>
<p>3. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,
perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective
Works;</p>
<p>4. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,
perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
transmission Derivative Works;</p>
<p>The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats
whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include
the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary
to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not
expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.</p>
<p>4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is
expressly made subject to and limited by the following
restrictions:</p>
<p>1. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the
Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the
recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not
sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that
control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the
terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as
incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the
Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to
the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon
notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or
the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work,
upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or
the Original Author, as requested.</p>
<p>2. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms
of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly
display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may
not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or
restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices
that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You
may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform the Derivative Work with any technological
measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above
applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective
Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
License.</p>
<p>3. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in
Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or
directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works
by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be
considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no
payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the
exchange of copyrighted works.</p>
<p>4. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or
Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for
the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the
medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or
pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the
title of the Work if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a
credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work
(e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such
credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work,
at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable
authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as
such other comparable authorship credit.</p>
<p>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer</p>
<p>1. By offering the Work for public release under this License,
Licensor represents and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's
knowledge after reasonable inquiry:</p>
<p>1. Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to
grant the license rights hereunder and to permit the lawful
exercise of the rights granted hereunder without You having any
obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory license fees, residuals
or any other payments;</p>
<p>2. The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark,
publicity rights, common law rights or any other right of any third
party or constitute defamation, invasion of privacy or other
tortious injury to any third party.</p>
<p>2. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE
AGREED IN WRITING OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS
LICENSED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.</p>
<p>6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A
THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5,
IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<p>7. Termination</p>
<p>1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or
Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not
have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1,
2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.</p>
<p>2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license
granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor
reserves the right to release the Work under different license
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided,
however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be,
granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.</p>
<p>8. Miscellaneous</p>
<p>1. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the
Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
granted to You under this License.</p>
<p>2. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a
Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
granted to You under this License.</p>
<p>3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
without further action by the parties to this agreement, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make
such provision valid and enforceable.</p>
<p>4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived
and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be
in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver
or consent.</p>
<p>5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the
Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
agreement of the Licensor and You.</p>
