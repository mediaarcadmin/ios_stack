an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning
to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in
the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her
daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday,
which would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to
receive them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not
propitious, at least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was
impatient to get home. Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could
not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her
postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed
them to stay longer, she could spare them very well. Against
staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved—nor did
she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as
being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged
Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it
was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that
morning should be mentioned, and the request made.</p>
<p>The communication excited many professions of concern; and
enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following
day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred.
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for
her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection
for the other.</p>
<p>The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to
go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it
would not be safe for her—that she was not enough recovered; but
Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.</p>
<p>To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence—Elizabeth had been at
Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked—and
Miss Bingley was uncivil to&#160;<em>her</em>, and more teasing
than usual to himself. He wisely resolved to be particularly
careful that no sign of admiration
should&#160;<em>now</em>&#160;escape him, nothing that could
elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible
that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the
last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it.
Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through
the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by
themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his
book, and would not even look at her.</p>
<p>On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable
to almost all, took place. Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth
increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane;
and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it
would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or
Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands
with the former. Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the
liveliest of spirits.</p>
<p>They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs.
Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to
give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold
again. But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of
pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance
in the family circle. The evening conversation, when they were all
assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense
by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.</p>
<p>They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass
and human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new
observations of threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and
Lydia had information for them of a different sort. Much had been
done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding
Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their
uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted
that Colonel Forster was going to be married.</p>
